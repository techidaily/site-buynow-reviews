Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036486/19272" target="_top" id="2036486">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036486" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036486/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs"><a href="#Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs"></a><strong>Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs</strong></h2><p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130869/7443" target="_top" id="2130869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market. Indeed, at that price, it’s the least expensive one we tested, yet no part of it feels like any corners were cut in terms of quality or performance.</p><p> At that price point, it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036472/19272" target="_top" id="2036472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036472/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme"><a href="#Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme" class="headerlink" title="Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme"></a><strong>Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme</strong></h2><p><strong><em>DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter:</em></strong>  When it comes down to it these two units are surprisingly similar, down to the case and overall design of the unit. If you really want the ability to use your jump starter to also charge your laptop the DBPOWER is worth a look. Otherwise, save yourself around $10 and stick with the Beatit BT-D11.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dbpower-djs50-jump-starter-review-4783966" >DBPOWER Portable Car Jump Starter Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong><em>M MOOCK 1000A Peak 18000mAh Car Jump Starter:</em></strong>  This is another case of asking yourself how much you need the option to charge a laptop. The M MOOCK jump starter can but is also roughly $8 more. Its case is more of a flat square as well, so it slides more easily under seats. It’s a toss-up here, but the Beatit BT-D11 is a slightly better choice overall.</p><p> To read more reviews, check out our roundup of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-portable-jump-starters-4140286" >best portable jump starters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>For the price, it’s perfect.</strong></p><p> In a crowded field, there are few units that are as easy to recommend as the Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter. It has relatively few features when compared to some of its competitors but otherwise excels at what it’s designed to do. Charge it up, keep it stashed in your vehicle, and you’ll have a perfect tool to easily provide a jump to whatever vehicle needs it.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  800A BT-D11 Car Jump Starter</li><li>Product Brand  Beatit</li><li>MPN  BT-D11</li><li>Price  $70.00</li><li>Weight  1.19 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.24 x 3.42 x 1.5 in.</li><li>Capacity  18,000mAh</li><li>Power Input  15V&#x2F;1A port (delivered via wall charger or 12V car socket)</li><li>Jumping Peak Output Current  800A</li><li>Jumping Start Output Current  400A</li><li>Additional Power Output  USB: 2 ports; 5V&#x2F;2.1A and 5V&#x2F;1A</li><li>Operating Temperature Range  -25 to 60C &#x2F; -13F to 140F</li><li>Warranty  2-year limited</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-syncing-twitter-and-snapchat-for-sharing-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Syncing Twitter & Snapchat for Sharing Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-unveiling-youtubes-monetization-process/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unveiling YouTube's Monetization Process</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-inside-the-world-of-toolwiz-an-in-depth-software-review/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Inside the World of Toolwiz An In-Depth Software Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premier-iphone-watermark-apps-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Premier iPhone Watermark Apps Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-time-honored-treasures-free-of-restrictions/"><u>2024 Approved Time-Honored Treasures, Free of Restrictions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-make-windows-look-like-macos/"><u>5 Ways to Make Windows Look Like macOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/change-location-on-yik-yak-for-your-realme-11x-5g-to-enjoy-more-fun-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Change Location on Yik Yak For your Realme 11X 5G to Enjoy More Fun | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/head-to-head-battle-comparing-apple-watch-series-9-with-the-fitbit-charge-6-features/"><u>Head-to-Head Battle: Comparing Apple Watch Series 9 with the Fitbit Charge 6 Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/hunt-down-high-quality-phones-top-retailers-ranked-and-reviewed/"><u>Hunt Down High-Quality Phones: Top Retailers Ranked and Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/in-2024-adding-media-instagrams-guide/"><u>In 2024, Adding Media Instagram's Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-acer-chromebook-15-analysis-solid-performance-on-large-display/"><u>In-Depth Acer Chromebook 15 Analysis - Solid Performance on Large Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-on-the-well-crafted-netatmo-weather-station-a-dream-product-for-app-users/"><u>In-Depth Analysis on the Well-Crafted Netatmo Weather Station: A Dream Product for App Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/significant-temperature-reduction-with-the-direct-die-aio-cooler-from-ek-solutions-for-intel-139/"><u>Significant Temperature Reduction with the Direct Die AIO Cooler From EK Solutions for Intel 139</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-case-for-adopting-macos-monterey-early/"><u>The Case for Adopting macOS Monterey Early</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/top-rated-router-solutions-with-built-in-parental-controls/"><u>Top-Rated Router Solutions with Built-In Parental Controls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-poweradd-pilot-pro2-high-efficiency-charger-review-for-laptops-and-devices/"><u>Ultimate Guide to the POWERADD Pilot Pro2 - High-Efficiency Charger Review for Laptops & Devices</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As a looter-shooter lover (especially of the Borderlands series), I was intrigued by the prospect of using swords and shields instead of guns. At first, it was a fun, enthralling experience due to the compelling graphics. Unfortunately, after eleven hours of gameplay, I’ve already shelved it and moved on to the next game in my library due to its repetitive nature and poor plotline. Read on for how I evaluated the gameplay, plot, and graphics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/H6t9YHOQhs7GMJ8lP75_d2mnMVU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Godfall-PC-Game-4-cd60ab2e603a4efaa0031f8aa5743fb4.jpg"                      alt="Godfall"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037346/7443" target="_top" id="2037346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037346/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Rebecca Isaacs &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139563/4704" target="_top" id="2139563">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139563" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139563/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-What’s-that"><a href="#Plot-What’s-that" class="headerlink" title="Plot: What’s that?"></a>Plot: What’s that?</h2><p> “It was all a lie,” the narrator says, signaling the beginning of the game. What follows is an elaborate cut scene depicting everything I’d want in an adventure game: betrayal, battle, and of course, a desire for bloodthirsty vengeance.</p><p> You play as the character Orin, a Valorian Knight on the planet Aperion who starts off as a male character, but as you gain armors throughout gameplay, can become gender fluid to your preference. Orin has a brother, named Macros. However, a story can make or break a game, and I didn’t really see a reason why these siblings were waving swords at each other in the beginning cutscene. I was left wondering what it was Macros did in order to incur the wrath of Orin’s revenge. Whatever Macros did, Orin felt it was enough to go on a quest to destroy Macros.</p><p> From the starting cutscene, the plot was completely lost to me. I’m sure there was one, but it seemed so bland and common that I was drifting off to looking at the scenery during gameplay rather than paying attention to the storyline. For all the energy that the developers poured into the graphics, the plot suffered greatly, often leaving a shallowness that left me unsympathetic toward Orin and whatever quest he or she ultimately went on.</p><p> If the devil is in the details, then Counterplay sold its soul to ensure that every leaf had ridges and grooves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Gorgeous"><a href="#Graphics-Gorgeous" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Gorgeous"></a>Graphics: Gorgeous</h2><p> For a bland plot, Godfall really brings its A-game with the graphics. Some of the scenes as I ran across streams and trails brought out vivid hues and beautiful environments. If the devil is in the details, then Counterplay Games sold its soul to ensure that every leaf had ridges and grooves. In that aspect, the game shines, and I felt transported into the world as I ran around destroying my enemies with a greatsword.</p><p> Though repetitive, the four maps offered show a rich, colorful world that will keep your attention from the poor plotline for a while. Even the different sets of armor, known as Valorplates, are so detailed I was tempted to try to reach through my screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IWN-3bTZ5qlsx29Xu_o7m5dQyu8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Godfall-PC-Game-3-9be349303fa148cfbcacfa7551c5c743.jpg"                      alt="Godfall "                ></p><p>Rebecca Isaacs &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Repetitive-and-tedious"><a href="#Gameplay-Repetitive-and-tedious" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Repetitive and tedious"></a>Gameplay: Repetitive and tedious</h2><p> Valorian Knight Orin himself remains the same, but in terms of details and build, that’s where character customization—and offensive and defensive builds—finally come in. You’ll hack and slash your way through forests and other settings, using various Valorplates and one of five different weapons classes. As a bonus, you can add banners and charms to help buff up your Valorian Knight.</p><p> Each of the armor sets, based on various animals, comes with different perks, which makes for unique gameplay if you prefer poison or shock to fire damage. It can take some time to craft, modify, and upgrade both the Valorplates and weapons. More importantly, it takes time to gather the materials, so as you continue the game, you’ll have repeat quests and maps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lkXYe9qqH3ccZewQudKpzPWU4Xc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Godfall-PC-Game-2-fc516034a42a462ba1b4ab03bcc76269.jpg"                      alt="Godfall"                ></p><p>Rebecca Isaacs &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> That’s where Godfall’s biggest issue rears its head. I would love to tell you that it was a fun experience. I can get past a poor plot within reason. However, the constant replay of maps coupled with the eventually monotonous backgrounds made gameplay more tedious than fun. Counterplay tried to make it more intriguing by offering some attack combinations and a few variations of monsters, but there aren’t that many across either spectrum. Instead, you’ll have to boost the few extra attacks the game offers through a grid-like skill tree.</p><p> If puzzles are a necessity in your looter slasher video game, Godfall does offer very small ones by showing locked chests every once in a while. In order to move across the map you have to rely on “phase nodes” to shift you across chasms and past cliffs, but there’s virtually no climbing, and the puzzles turn as dull and drab as the plotline. At most, you’re usually left throwing your shield at the hidden locks to break them.</p><p> You’ll hack and slash your way through forests, using various Valorplates and one of five different weapons classes.</p><p> In all honesty, the game feels half-finished, as though Counterplay didn’t get a chance to put out something they really wanted to, but were forced to due to PlayStation 5 release time constraints. There are great moments in the gameplay, especially during the boss battles. But after a few hours, I found it hard to feel motivated to continue playing when everything was so repetitive.</p><p> And, worse yet, the co-op mode was insufferable. In order to play co-op with a friend, you’ll have to invite them to every mission, every single time. It makes sense if you’re starting out, but it doesn’t make sense when you’re on your fifth mission of the night, and you can’t start unless you invite your best friend. It’s time-consuming and clearly wasn’t thought out that well.</p><p> Not all the gameplay features are gripe worthy though. With up close combat, dying is inevitable, and Godfall makes sure to address the risk of constant death in three ways: a practice arena in between missions, where you can test out your latest combos; easy, fast leveling; and no death penalty. While some players will most likely balk at no death penalty, casual gamers will enjoy not having to worry about the loss of experience or equipment durability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xztzESfeykd-1UUo9xAOFt8EPNE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Godfall-PC-Game-7-4a134c4dc6304645aaeb4ff4a0badefa.jpg"                      alt="Godfall"                ></p><p>Rebecca Isaacs &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Platform-PS5-or-PC"><a href="#Platform-PS5-or-PC" class="headerlink" title="Platform: PS5 or PC"></a>Platform: PS5 or PC</h2><p> Godfall is pretty straightforward with its platforms: PlayStation 5, or Windows PCs. It does not work on Macs, so take that into consideration before you make your purchase. In terms of gameplay, neither platform really weighs better than the other, though PC gamers with ultrawide screens may have some issues getting the correct resolution set.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AVwuGUypRGjuigcAvp7eBT4rj00=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Godfall-PC-Game-6-d175a22d9d0c48e8ad3aad12177fe50b.jpg"                      alt="Godfall "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1265663">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1265663">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmartinic.evyy.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1265663%2F4482'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1265663/4482"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Rebecca Isaacs &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Price-Overpriced-for-the-amount-of-content-available"><a href="#Price-Overpriced-for-the-amount-of-content-available" class="headerlink" title="Price: Overpriced for the amount of content available"></a>Price: Overpriced for the amount of content available</h2><p> If Godfall was priced around $30, I would have been more sympathetic to its cause. However, the base game itself will cost around $60 before any kind of sale. If you want to upgrade to a higher edition, such as Deluxe or its top edition, Ascended, that will run you up to $90. That much money for a game that seems half-finished and still requires 50GB of SSD memory is, quite frankly, way too much for anyone to pay. This is also not including the option of pre-order and Ascended content, each of which will cost another $10.</p><p> I’ll be brutally honest here: if it’s between Godfall and Warframe, Warframe is easily a better game.</p><h2 id="Godfall-vs-Warframe"><a href="#Godfall-vs-Warframe" class="headerlink" title="Godfall vs. Warframe"></a>Godfall vs. Warframe</h2><p> The only game that can remotely come close to Godfall is Warframe. Both offer missions you can complete repetitively, and both require multiple hours of gameplay in order to progress in the game.</p><p> I’ll be brutally honest here: if it’s between Godfall and Warframe, Warframe is easily a better game. While Godfall offers beauty in the natural world, Warframe builds on a seriously sci-fi world that’s constantly expanding.</p><p> More importantly, Warframe offers its players who want that looter slasher experience something Godfall cannot: mostly free gameplay. While Warframe relies on microtransactions, the base game is free—and requires lots of hours of gameplay to advance. As much as I wanted to recommend Godfall, the fact is that Warframe does what Godfall wanted to do for better and for less of a cost (unless you really want to engage in microtransactions).</p><p> In all honesty, the game feels half-finished, as though Counterplay didn’t get a chance to put out something they really wanted to, but were forced to due to PlayStation 5 release time constraints.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Scenery doesn’t make up for lackluster gameplay.</strong></p><p> If you’re looking for a mindless hack and slash game to play, this might be a go-to game for you, especially if you like Warframe. But as much as I loved the graphics, I can’t recommend Godfall based on the landscapes alone. If you feel obligated to try out a melee looter slasher, wait for a sale, but for most people you can find better games to play.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880927/19272" target="_top" id="1880927">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880927" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880927/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-new-setting-for-the-series-5085469" >Watch Dogs: Legion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/marvel-s-avengers-review-5088311" >Marvel’s Avengers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Godfall</li><li>UPC  850012348047</li><li>Price  $59.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Weight  4.11 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  0.6 x 5.3 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Color  N&#x2F;A</li><li>Rating  Teen</li><li>Genre  Action, Adventure</li><li>Available Platforms  PS5, Windows 10 PC</li><li>Processor Minimum  Intel Core i5-6600 | AMD Ryzen 5 1600</li><li>Memory Minimum  50 GB (SSD Recommended)</li><li>Graphics  Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060, 6 GB | AMD Radeon RX 580, 8 GB</li><li>Network  Internet connection required</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-chromeos-direct-screens-capture-tool/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved ChromeOS Direct Screens Capture Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-tactics-for-gameplay-screen-captures/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top Tactics for Gameplay Screen Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovative-ways-to-boost-your-snapchat-engagement/"><u>2024 Approved Innovative Ways to Boost Your Snapchat Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/clicks-to-cash-elevating-exposure-economics/"><u>From Clicks to Cash Elevating Exposure Economics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/is-buying-a-kindle-worth-it-4-reasons-to-buy-one/"><u>Is Buying a Kindle Worth It? 4 Reasons to Buy One</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/keep-up-with-trends/"><u>Keep Up With Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/maximizing-your-wireless-range-a-closer-look-at-the-tp-link-re505x/"><u>Maximizing Your Wireless Range - A Closer Look at the TP-Link RE505X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/microsoft-office-replacements-ranking-the-top-picks/"><u>Microsoft Office Replacements - Ranking the Top Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/overcoming-runtime-errors-in-total-war-warhammer-ii-for-uninterrupted-gaming/"><u>Overcoming Runtime Errors in Total War: WARHAMMER II for Uninterrupted Gaming</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148773/18498" target="_top" id="2148773">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148773" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148773/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129738/7443" target="_top" id="2129738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049364/7443" target="_top" id="2049364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049364/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049391/7443" target="_top" id="2049391">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049391" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049391/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151864/7443" target="_top" id="2151864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144271/7443" target="_top" id="2144271">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144271" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144271/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136548/16384" target="_top" id="2136548">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136548" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136548/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-jotunheims-gambit-warriors-of-ragnarok/"><u>2024 Approved Jotunheim's Gambit Warriors of Ragnarok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-unlock-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-to-use-usb-accessories-without-passcode-by-drfone-ios/"><u>4 Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Use USB Accessories Without Passcode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/exploring-affordability-and-functionality-with-the-miniature-asus-vivobook-11/"><u>Exploring Affordability & Functionality with the Miniature Asus VivoBook 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/hassle-free-connections-3-innovative-ways-to-link-laptop-plus-hp/"><u>Hassle-Free Connections: 3 Innovative Ways to Link Laptop + HP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-oppo-a79-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Error 495 While Download/Updating Android Apps On Oppo A79 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-android-sim-unlock-code-generators-unlock-your-motorola-edge-40-pro-phone-hassle-free-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Best Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Unlock Your Motorola Edge 40 Pro Phone Hassle-Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-4-ways-to-trace-xiaomi-civi-3-disney-100th-anniversary-edition-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 4 Ways to Trace Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/leading-stereo-amplifiers-on-the-market-expert-picks-for-2n24/"><u>Leading Stereo Amplifiers on the Market -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re considering leveling up to a wristwatch that can do more than tell time, but want the look and feel of a typical watch, you may be interested in a hybrid smartwatch. The Withings Move falls right into this group of devices that have more capability than a regular watch and still look like a classic timepiece. It offers fitness tracking but doesn’t require you to be plugged in at all times like most smartwatches.</p><p> We tested the Withings Move to see how comfortable it is for everyday use and explore the extent of its smartwatch characteristics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SRCqvDOet8fouJ8uY8ze0LlCiog=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-2-1fdc9f06eb6a45f2baa2b840822fba5d.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Slim-and-clean"><a href="#Design-Slim-and-clean" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slim and clean"></a><strong>Design: Slim and clean</strong></h2><p> We don’t typically think of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as being nearly weightless, but the Withings Move is just that. Weighing in at just a little over one ounce, this watch is almost undetectable on the wrist.</p><p> That’s because there’s nothing really heavy in the construction of the device. The back of the face is made of stainless steel, but the case protecting the face is plastic. The lack of weight is nice, but the plastic coupled with the somewhat-flimsy silicone band gives the watch a less refined feel. An added boost to the slim profile is the water-resistance of up to 50 meters, but that seems like a contradiction given the lack of ruggedness in the design.</p><p> Weighing in at just a little over one ounce, this watch is almost undetectable on the wrist.</p><p> At first glance, it looks like your average sporty analog watch. But it’s easy to spot the hint that this device has more functionality. In addition to the usual time and second hands, the Withings Move also features a smaller subdial. This section is labeled from 0-100, and this is where your step goal progress is measured (by percent of completion).</p><p> As far as buttons go, there’s only one, and it’s in the usual spot on the right side of the watch face. It’s not used for winding, though. This is the button you’ll rely on for shutting off the alarm function and starting&#x2F;stopping a workout session.</p><p> Depending on the category you fall into, the lack of a touchscreen could be the largest benefit or drawback of the design. Users who want the look of a regular analog watch will be pleased by the lack of a typical smartwatch screen on their wrist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Qz1dlsE8jl99mXc7-kQ5LCVoiK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-3-b1e97631284d40829bd5714c59dc5f2a.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-As-easy-as-1-2-3"><a href="#Setup-Process-As-easy-as-1-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :As easy as 1-2-3"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>As easy as 1-2-3</strong></h2><p> Given such a simple and clean design, it’s natural to expect the setup process to be the same. We found that to be the case.</p><p> The Withings Move comes with no chargers, cables, or ports of any kind, so there’s no charging required out of the box. All the work is done through the complementary Health Mate app, which we downloaded from the App Store.</p><p> The first thing we had to do was sign up for an account in order to move forward with the installation. After we did that, most of the steps took just a few seconds or up to a minute at the longest.</p><p> First, we paired the Withings Move with our phone via Bluetooth, which was instantaneous. Next, we provided profile information for better activity metrics, downloaded an update, made sure the watch dials were working and the time was set correctly, and we were good to go.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Light-as-a-feather-even-while-sleeping"><a href="#Comfort-Light-as-a-feather-even-while-sleeping" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Light as a feather, even while sleeping"></a><strong>Comfort: Light as a feather, even while sleeping</strong></h2><p> Some watches can feel heavy by the end of the day, but we didn’t encounter that weighed-down feeling with the Withings Move. The watch is really lightweight and the band is soft, flexible, and slim, which made sleeping with it a non-issue. It was also easy to achieve a good fit—especially for smaller wrists—thanks to the plentiful notches and the tab to keep the band in place.</p><p> The Withings Move is not a flashy device with lots of buttons. The button on the side is only used to silence the alarm you set through the app or to initiate an activity session. Because of the comfort and the sleek look, it’s definitely versatile enough to wear on a daily basis. It doesn’t scream “sport watch,” but it’s also not overly decorative, offering an appealing mid-way point between sporty and dressy.</p><p> We did notice that both the front and back of the watch face scratched easily over the course of a week, and suspect this could be a bigger issue for those who are harder on their accessories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WIXFA6BpXvAMWLdKpJ_jmzZh6o4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-5-cbc0f43d847b453bbfae994f03374cdb.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-Limited-activity-tracking"><a href="#Performance-Limited-activity-tracking" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Limited activity tracking"></a><strong>Performance: Limited activity tracking</strong></h2><p> While hybrid smartwatches like the Withings Move offer ease of use and versatility with your wardrobe and daily wear, they’re limited when it comes to tracking performance. Some activities are automatically recorded: walking, running, hiking, and swimming. With outdoor exercising, you can also track distance and elevation with the connected GPS feature.</p><p> There’s also support for all kinds of other general fitness activities like indoor cycling, weight training, and pilates. All you have to do to log these exercises is to wear the device and launch a workout session by holding the button on the watch for a second or two until it vibrates. That’s the same action for stopping the workout, too.</p><p> It offers fitness tracking but doesn’t require you to be plugged in at all times like most smartwatches.</p><p> Most activities allow you to track your speed, activity length and type, steps taken, and calories burned. You won’t be able to monitor active heart rate for any activity, though. And swimming is even more limited: you can only track how long you’ve swum and the calories exerted. The big bottom line to remember, however, is for any distance-based activity you want to log, you’ll need your smartphone.</p><p> We took the Withings Move (and our smartphone) on a run and a walk, and just like it says it will, the watch automatically detected our activity. When we compared it with our usual step trackers, a Garmin 35 and the iHealth app, steps were comparable. For running activity, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the pace was pretty much spot on. But we missed having information about overall pace, cadence, active heart rate, and distance indicators on the watch face itself.</p><p> We also tested the water-resistance while washing dishes and in the shower. The Withings Move is water-resistant up to 50 meters, which, according to the manufacturer, makes it acceptable for lap swimming, splashing, and dishwashing. Even though we didn’t put it to the depth test, it held up to submersion in soapy water and never missed a beat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vaUmI1isQP98tmL8uIZSghmAWGs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-6-259d8034cfb64485be60f9c5754fec79.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144273/7443" target="_top" id="2144273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144273/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Battery-Long-lasting-and-hassle-free"><a href="#Battery-Long-lasting-and-hassle-free" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Long-lasting and hassle-free"></a><strong>Battery: Long-lasting and hassle-free</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move is reported to have a battery life of up to 18 months, and we really enjoyed that aspect over the week we tested it. Unlike typical smartwatches, we didn’t have to worry about draining the battery and recharging. The internal battery is a typical replaceable watch battery, and the user guide offers directions for removal and replacement when the time comes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/02bkMrpkzqBOue1ffhHNfQqaIuk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-4-df866fafd70a44c592e0e06e0ea53ae7.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531882">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531882">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531882%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531882/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135396/19272" target="_top" id="2135396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135396/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-An-emphasis-on-general-wellness"><a href="#Software-An-emphasis-on-general-wellness" class="headerlink" title="Software: An emphasis on general wellness"></a><strong>Software: An emphasis on general wellness</strong></h2><p> Though activity data is somewhat limited, the Withings Move does offer some other more in-depth insights. Sleep activity, for example, is automatically detected and doesn’t require any other action besides wearing the watch while sleeping. When you wake in the morning, you’ll be able to view your quality of sleep for the previous night based on the number of interruptions, duration, and even depth of sleep. There is a hiccup with this feature, though—we noticed when we took it off at our desk one morning, it seemed to think we had fallen back asleep and continued reading our sleep quality.</p><p> Another tracking perk is the resting heart rate measuring feature. This requires that you give the Health Mate app permission to access your phone camera, but if you do this, simply placing your finger in front of your camera lens enables the app to sense your pulse and turn out a resting heart rate reading. The reading could be quite slow if we didn’t remain entirely still, which is almost impossible to achieve completely.</p><p> But that quirk aside, the heart rate feature is an appealing addition to a device that offers few flourishes. It obviously does require your smartphone, but all activity (which can also be viewed on the web through your Withings account) is closely tethered to your device.</p><p> Despite the lack of a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-touchscreen-4144770" >touchscreen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or dashboard interface on the watch, it was never difficult to sync data with the Health Mate app or view metrics. It’s easy and uncomplicated to use for recording or launching activities—including<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-food-tracker-apps-4172287" >tracking food <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the MyFitnessPal integration. Since the app is really what provides the “smart” qualities of the device, we hoped it would deliver on that, and it did.</p><p> There are also a number of other supplemental programs you can sign up for through the Health Connect app in order to up your general wellness. Most of these programs, which are free to join, require a specific type of Withings device, but others, like a meditation and pregnancy tracking program, don’t need any additional equipment.</p><h2 id="Price-A-bargain-for-the-value"><a href="#Price-A-bargain-for-the-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bargain for the value"></a><strong>Price: A bargain for the value</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move retails for $69.95, which is an attractive and affordable price for a hybrid smartwatch—most competitors tend to be well above $100. While these other models, like the Fossil Harper and Fossil Q Commuter, typically come with more functionality like music storage or streaming, notifications, or taking a picture from your phone, there’s also a bigger price associated with those features.</p><p> Those looking for a dressier and more substantial watch may find these Fossil models to be better alternatives. Other devices that are comparable in price, like the Fitbit Inspire Fitness Tracker, lack the analog watch qualities and look like designated activity trackers. The Withings Move splits the difference at a modest price.</p><h2 id="Withings-Move-vs-Misfit-Phase"><a href="#Withings-Move-vs-Misfit-Phase" class="headerlink" title="Withings Move vs. Misfit Phase"></a><strong>Withings Move vs. Misfit Phase</strong></h2><p> The Misfit Phase is another hybrid smartwatch with a classic wristwatch look, maybe even more so than the Withings Move. Priced at around $175, the Misfit Phase is more expensive, but also comes with a few bonuses that the Withings Move lacks, like text notifications, playing and pausing music on your phone, and also taking selfies.</p><p> On the other hand, the Misfit Phase’s battery life is less impressive (up to six months) and it’s considerably heavier at nearly seven ounces. It also lacks the subdial feature. If you want more impressive looks and some flashier details, you may be happier paying extra for the Misfit Phase. But if you’re a fan of less equipment on your wrist, the Withings Move could satisfy your hybrid smartwatch wishes.</p><p> Are you interested in weighing other hybrid and smartwatch options? Take a look at our roundup of the best smartwatches for women and the best cheap smartwatches.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Best for those who prefer the analog experience.</strong></p><p> The Withings Move is a strong entry-level fitness tracker for the person who wants to track activities without going all-in on a smartwatch. It’s inexpensive, sporty, and subtle, which makes it compelling for those who don’t want to be distracted by notifications and all the hands-on features smartwatches bring to the table.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135355/19272" target="_top" id="2135355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135355/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Withings Move Hybrid Smartwatch</li><li>Product Brand  Withings</li><li>Price  $69.99</li><li>Weight  1.12 oz.</li><li>Battery Capacity  18 months</li><li>Compatibility  iOS 10+, Android 6+</li><li>Waterproof  Yes, up to 50 meters</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth</li><li>Warranty  2 years</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-7-leading-free-tiktok-audio-tools-for-seamless-mp3-conversion-for-2024/"><u>[New] 7 Leading Free TikTok Audio Tools for Seamless MP3 Conversion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-interpreting-differences-360-and-virtual-reality-cinematography/"><u>[New] In 2024, Interpreting Differences 360° and Virtual Reality Cinematography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-efficacy-of-vlcs-screen-recording/"><u>[New] The Efficacy of VLC's Screen Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-visionary-studios-pioneering-next-gen-virtual-realms/"><u>[Updated] Visionary Studios Pioneering Next-Gen Virtual Realms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/best-tablets-ranked-by-cpu-capabilities-what-you-need-to-know/"><u>Best Tablets Ranked by CPU Capabilities -

I tested the LH4830 for weeks in my cramped kitchen to see if a little TV like the LH4830 could still add a lot of value and compared it to other TVs on our list of the best cheap TVs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105876/7443" target="_top" id="2105876">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105876" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105876/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Decidedly-minimalist"><a href="#Design-Decidedly-minimalist" class="headerlink" title="Design: Decidedly minimalist"></a><strong>Design: Decidedly minimalist</strong></h2><p> There is nothing flashy about the LG 24-inch LH4830. Half-inch bezels on three sides of the screen create a clean, modern shape that stops just short of being boxy. Edge to edge panels aren’t an option at this price point, where a costly design would cut into more meaningful additions, like better resolution or speakers.</p><p> The stand takes under a second to attach to the TV, sliding into place with a snap. With a depth of 2.1 inches without the sand, this television is suitable for wall mounting. After testing primarily in the kitchen, I turned it into a second monitor that can be tucked against the wall when not in use or returned to its TV functionality when guests are visiting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nXJoYyubvcUPiVfJUWhITECGHww=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4061017-LGElectronics24LH4830-PU24-InchSmartLEDTV2016Model-04-47b70d6fa03e4bc6bd4da8edf6085220.jpg"                      alt="LG 24LH4830 Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Sandra Stafford</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Use-your-new-TV-in-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Use-your-new-TV-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Use your new TV in minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process: Use your new TV in minutes</strong></h2><p> There are only a few on-screen prompts to follow to set up the LH4830, so it shouldn’t take longer than a minute or two.

Unless you remember to turn the volume down before turning the TV off, you’ll be greeted by the roar of static when you turn the TV on again. An increasing number of people don’t have cable subscriptions at all, so this is a pretty big oversight.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Interface-LG-webOS-is-clean-and-modern"><a href="#Interface-LG-webOS-is-clean-and-modern" class="headerlink" title="Interface: LG webOS is clean and modern"></a><strong>Interface: LG webOS is clean and modern</strong></h2><p> Android TV is a more universal operating system for smart TVs to use, but I was surprised to find that I preferred<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lg-channel-plus-what-you-need-to-know-4074929" >LG’s webOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Switching between apps is intuitive, and they’re all neatly organized along the bottom of the screen.

The picture looks perfectly clear, with no significant blurring or smearing. Even during_Avengers: Infinity War_ , a movie with numerous lengthy fight scenes, the TV was able to deliver a fairly crisp picture. The color is just as beautiful on this small model as on LG’s larger televisions, with a rich vibrancy to the green of Gamora’s skin and the dark, beautiful tones of Vormir.</p><p> I was pleasantly surprised by the wide viewing angle of the LG 24LH4830. After only having TVs with VA panels, I expected the same narrow viewing angles that kept me glued to the center of my couch for years. Testing the TV in my kitchen, I had no problem seeing the screen from anywhere in the room. There was no significant loss in color or contrast unless I was practically beside the television. Wherever I was in the cooking or cleanup process, I could look up and spend a few minutes watching “Ozark” without losing details of the dark scenes.</p><p> The LH4830 can be calibrated by a technician with two ISF expert modes, and it has several preset modes that will be plenty for most other users. The Cinema mode was ideal when I tested the TV in my kitchen, with a warm color temperature that is easier on the eyes and looks better in the evening. While cooking, I would turn the picture mode to Game and play rounds of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The Game mode’s latency reduction and motion handling are great for such a budget TV.</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Underpowered-speakers"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Underpowered-speakers" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Underpowered speakers"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Underpowered speakers</strong></h2><p> The LH4830 has two 5W speakers that do their best to deliver virtual<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/720p-1080i-1080p-explained-3276378" >surround sound <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The audio quality is adequate for a TV of this size, but not great. Even with auto volume leveling, soft sounds like whispering are often lost, requiring that the volume be frequently adjusted. Background noise like a dishwasher or air conditioner is going to be enough to drown out the volume of these underpowered speakers. All of that said, I can’t criticize the LH4830 too much. Very few TVs wouldn’t benefit from a dedicated speaker system or soundbar, especially at this price point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BCLpbJ0Nr9vB4BBQjei4aC_jzg8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4061017-LGElectronics24LH4830-PU24-InchSmartLEDTV2016Model-02-17f260630f0749ea8529daf9a13c3c01.jpg"                      alt="LG 24LH4830 Smart TV"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880956/19272" target="_top" id="1880956">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880956" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880956/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Sandra Stafford</p><h2 id="Apps-LG-Content-Store-could-use-more-robust-selection"><a href="#Apps-LG-Content-Store-could-use-more-robust-selection" class="headerlink" title="Apps: LG Content Store could use more robust selection"></a><strong>Apps: LG Content Store could use more robust selection</strong></h2><p> After setup, the LH4830 goes automatically to the LG Content Store. The LG Content Store does have apps like Netflix and YouTube, but the selection other than those is seriously limited. Other LG televisions do have access to the Hulu app, so we assume that it will be added to this one in a later update, but if Hulu is a must, then this is not the right choice. As a secondary television, the loss of Hulu isn’t a big deal. The television is compatible with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-devices-to-buy-for-streaming-tv-4061016" >Roku and Apple TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , though, so you can work around the lack of app support.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gUelIOzwsKr5o2f2yWumqzKIomI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4061017-LGElectronics24LH4830-PU24-InchSmartLEDTV2016Model-03-3f829dc8cb05440ea4c8cf67f706694f.jpg"                      alt="LG 24LH4830 Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Sandra Stafford</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958378/18409" target="_top" id="1958378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1958378/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Competitively-priced-for-its-features"><a href="#Price-Competitively-priced-for-its-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Competitively priced for its features"></a><strong>Price: Competitively priced for its features</strong></h2><p> A look at the competition of smart TVs under 24 inches shows that the LH4830 is fairly priced for what it offers. For around $140, it’s a well-made smart TV running on a very stable operating system. The wide-angle panel and small size allow it to be effectively used in a great variety of small spaces, and on a screen this size it doesn’t make sense to pay for much better quality.</p><p> For around $140, it’s a well-made smart TV running on a very stable operating system.</p><h2 id="LG-24LH4830-vs-VIZIO-D24F-G1"><a href="#LG-24LH4830-vs-VIZIO-D24F-G1" class="headerlink" title="LG 24LH4830 vs. VIZIO D24F-G1"></a><strong>LG 24LH4830 vs. VIZIO D24F-G1</strong></h2><p> If 720p is too much of a drop in image quality for you, then the VIZIO D series is worth looking at. With specs virtually identical to the LG, this is a decision about which one you are willing to pay for. The VIZIO D24F-G1 (view<a class="link"   href="https://www.vizio.com/en/tv/d-series/D24f-G1?bvstate=pg:2/ct:r=&bvstate=pg:3/ct:r" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is the same size and perfectly well suited to wall mounting. Last, the VIZIO uses the Android TV operating system. That wasn’t the one that we preferred in testing, but people who are already used to it and want the wide variety of apps enough to deal with some minor instability issues will enjoy it.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A small smart TV that packs a punch.</strong></p><p> The LG 24LH4830 brings a lot of functionality to an undersized part of the TV market. With a wide viewing panel that shows bright, true color no matter where you are in the living room, it’s the perfect choice for TVs that need to fit into small spaces.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  24LH4830-PU 24-Inch Smart LED TV</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>MPN  24LH4830-PU</li><li>Price  $140.00</li><li>Weight  7.5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  21.9 x 2.1 x 13.6 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Compatibility  Roku, Apple Play</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-download-powerhouse-top-free-quick-vids-extraction-for-pinterest/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Download Powerhouse Top Free, Quick Vids Extraction for Pinterest</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unpacking-facebooks-freshest-features-in-top-vids/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unpacking Facebook's Freshest Features in Top Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-select-8-android-apps-combining-free-and-paid-video-collages/"><u>[New] Select 8 Android Apps Combining Free and Paid Video Collages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-masterclass-in-elegance-blurring-borders-for-zoom/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Masterclass in Elegance Blurring Borders for Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-high-performance-mac-editors-ranked-1-to-5/"><u>[Updated] High-Performance Mac Editors - Ranked #1 to #5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/deciphering-wi-fi-mesh-network-advantages/"><u>Deciphering Wi-Fi Mesh Network Advantages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/explore-the-premier-ecommerce-retailers-featuring-innovative-tv-displays/"><u>Explore the Premier Ecommerce Retailers Featuring Innovative TV Displays</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-assessment-of-the-tp-link-re505x-wi-fi-signal-booster/"><u>In-Depth Assessment of the TP-Link RE505X Wi-Fi Signal Booster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/introducing-innovation-and-sophistication-nixplay-iris-unveiled/"><u>Introducing Innovation & Sophistication: Nixplay Iris Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/iphone-faceoff-how-does-the-standard-iphone-15-stack-up-against-the-premium-15-pro-max/"><u>IPhone Faceoff: How Does the Standard iPhone 15 Stack Up Against the Premium 15 Pro Max?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/mastering-mouse-settings-a-guide-to-microsoft-drivers-update-for-windows-users/"><u>Mastering Mouse Settings: A Guide to Microsoft Drivers Update for Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/maximum-coverage-with-netgears-ex3700-wifi-repeater-a-detailed-evaluation/"><u>Maximum Coverage with Netgear's EX3700 WIFI Repeater - A Detailed Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-do-you-want-to-blur-faces-in-your-videos-read-this-article-to-find-out-the-easiest-way-to-blur-the-faces-in-videos-using-adobe-premiere-pro/"><u>New Do You Want to Blur Faces in Your Videos?

OLED has a far better screen than the Switch Lite. Its 7-inch display features OLED technology, which means a sharper and more vibrant image.</p><p> Having pixels that light up individually to each other means you get brighter colors and deeper blacks, so it looks far better in portable mode. The Nintendo Switch isn’t generally a visual powerhouse, but its game catalog is often vibrant, cute, and gorgeous on the right screen.</p><p> Playing games on the Switch OLED felt a bit more exciting. It might only be a visual improvement, but games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Wonder deserve to be presented in the best possible light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JW7hKEf91vIUGcKyO4x2xMI4paw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchLiteandSwitchOLED2-7589f20a94af406bb9df98aaaa23cd19.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite and Switch OLED gaming consoles."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> After upgrading from the Switch Lite to the Switch OLED, I replayed games to see how prettier they looked.</p><p> Due to the lack of a dock, you’re also dependent on connecting to the internet via Wi-Fi only when using a Switch Lite, compared to the Switch OLED, which has an Ethernet port. Similarly, there’s no way to connect the Switch Lite via HDMI, so you won’t be able to stream games from it.</p><p> The Switch OLED also has 64GB of internal storage compared to 32 GB on the Switch Lite, but in both cases, you can upgrade the storage with microSD cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983472">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983472%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983472/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Flexibility-Advantage-OLED"><a href="#Flexibility-Advantage-OLED" class="headerlink" title="Flexibility: Advantage OLED"></a>Flexibility: Advantage OLED</h2><p> The most significant difference between the Nintendo Switch OLED and the Switch Lite is its flexibility.</p><p> The Switch Lite is solely a portable gaming device. It works brilliantly for that, as I found when playing through many games while bedridden while recovering from surgery.</p><p> It’s very light to hold and isn’t too bulky, even for smaller hands. That’s why it’s particularly appealing to children, further helped by its plasticky shell, which feels like it can handle a few accidental drops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oxjDIc3a44xGYBV83bA1QcvlmXE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchOLED-074355b02db54dd1bb3e701d5674a9cb.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch OLED gaming console."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> The Nintendo Switch OLED is bulkier but can connect to your TV via the dock. Doing so lets you play multiplayer games once you unhook the Joy-Con controllers and gives you a bigger-screen experience compared to the Switch Lite.</p><p> Only one person at a time can play the Switch Lite, and you can’t detach the controllers, which means certain games won’t function with the Switch Lite—at least not unless you use separate Joy-Con controllers.</p><h2 id="Switch-Lite-Limited-Games"><a href="#Switch-Lite-Limited-Games" class="headerlink" title="Switch Lite: Limited Games"></a>Switch Lite: Limited Games</h2><p> The Switch Lite is helpful if you want a games console to use while traveling or to hand to your kids before a long journey.</p><p> However, if you plan to play games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on your TV for the whole family to join in, you’ll need the Switch or Switch OLED.</p><p> I tried playing multiplayer games on the Switch Lite by connecting a spare pair of Joy-Con controllers, but it’s a frustratingly small screen to do so.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TmYyOgzBYexzwHM_D35w2XJF68c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchLite1-33b6996f36534d1da9974a460e6c5139.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite gaming console."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> The Switch Lite is not compatible with the following games:</p><ul><li>1-2-Switch</li><li>All Just Dance games</li><li>Super Mario Party</li><li>Fitness Boxing</li><li>Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm &amp; Exercise</li><li>Ring Fit Adventure</li><li>Nintendo Switch Sports</li><li>Nintendo Labo (all sets)</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918684/19272" target="_top" id="1918684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Thoughts-Each-Model-Has-Its-Advantages"><a href="#Final-Thoughts-Each-Model-Has-Its-Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts: Each Model Has Its Advantages"></a>Final Thoughts: Each Model Has Its Advantages</h2><p> There’s no bad Nintendo Switch console.

It’s the cheapest way to play Switch games, but you won’t easily play other games with someone sitting next to you.</p><p> The Nintendo Switch will suffice if you plan on exclusively connecting it to your TV so you can play with friends and family easily or enjoy a bigger-screen experience.</p><p> There’s no need to pay for a superior screen if you plan to use your TV the whole time.</p><p> The Switch OLED’s screen is superior to an LCD one and is comfortable enough to complete large games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim without connecting it to the TV.</p><p> However, it’s helpful to connect it to the TV to play games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the family or when you want to take in more of a game.</p><h2 id="Compare-Features"><a href="#Compare-Features" class="headerlink" title="Compare Features"></a>Compare Features</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-White-Joy/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8641194%7Cnc6d456f639444f6296c51134fff57d6c15%7C" >Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></th><th><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-w-Neon-Blue-Neon-Red-Joy-Con/321765329?slpfid=3" > Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></th><th><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092VT1JGD?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8641194%7Cnc6d456f639444f6296c51134fff57d6c15%7C" > Lite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>7-inch OLED</td><td>6.2-inch LCD</td><td>5.5-inch LCD</td></tr><tr><td>9.4 x 4.0 x 0.6 inches</td><td>9.4 x 4.0 x 0.55</td><td>8.2 x 3.6 x 0.6</td></tr><tr><td>14.9 ounces</td><td>10.5 ounces</td><td>9.8 ounces</td></tr><tr><td>64GB Storage</td><td>32GB</td><td>32GB</td></tr><tr><td>October 2021</td><td>March 2017</td><td>September 2019</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-holistic-health-approaches-with-tech/"><u>[New] Holistic Health Approaches with Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-revolutionize-your-iphone-shots-free-swift-red-eye-elimination-techniques/"><u>[New] In 2024, Revolutionize Your iPhone Shots Free, Swift Red-Eye Elimination Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-interactive-media-adding-audio-to-visual-narratives-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Interactive Media Adding Audio to Visual Narratives for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-picture-puns-memify-pro/"><u>[Updated] Picture Puns Memify Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/approved-monetary-spectrum-a-glimpse-into-mr-beasts-world/"><u>2024 Approved Monetary Spectrum A Glimpse Into Mr. Beast’s World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/2024s-elite-selection-leading-asus-networking-devices/"><u>2024'S Elite Selection: Leading ASUS Networking Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/a-lack-of-response-to-electric-pulp-testing-does-not-always-indicate-a-non-vital-tooth-other-factors-such-as-recent-trauma-or-restorations-may-affect-result77/"><u>A Lack of Response to Electric Pulp Testing Does Not Always Indicate a Non-Vital Tooth;

There’s no performance drop here—just a more petite build.</p><p> I played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and it was still excellent fun and immersive. Exploring the console is straightforward and clearly laid out, so newcomers and children can quickly figure out what to do.</p><p> Games can be bought digitally or as physical cartridges.

The Nintendo Switch Lite can’t be docked like its bigger sibling, missing out on one of the reasons why it’s called a Switch.</p><p> Because of that, the Joy-Con controllers can’t be detached, so you’ll need to buy a separate controller to attempt to play multiplayer on the small screen.</p><p> Also, the lack of unattached Joy-Con controllers means no motion controls, which can affect many games.</p><p> Despite that, the Nintendo Switch Lite is an ideal entry point to gaming as it’s so easy to use.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, Digital Trends, GamesRadar, and Wirecutter all recommend the Nintendo Switch Lite.

During my time with them, I spent dozens of hours comparing them.</p><p> That included seeing how quickly each console loaded and allowed me to immediately play a game and how simple it was to do so.</p><p> I also looked at the number of games available for each system, any advantages they offer, and whether the controller felt comfortable and intuitive to use.</p><p> I also considered possibly the most critical factor – how much fun it was to play on each console, which made me want to return for more.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p> What to Look For</p><p> Buying a games console is never a cheap proposition, so buying the right one for you and your needs is essential, rather than making a mistake.</p><p> To help you figure out which game console is best for you, consider these key things before you buy:</p><p><strong>Who’s playing?</strong></p><p> All game consoles have a variety of games aimed at different age groups, but some are better for certain players than others.</p><p> For instance, PlayStation has many hard-hitting single-player experiences with stories exploring adult themes. It may also have games like Bluey and the Lego titles, but its strength is in more adult titles.</p><p> Alternatively, the Nintendo Switch has the Mario franchise, which is very family-friendly. Many couch co-op and multiplayer titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, offer a more sociable experience.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> Do you already own a console? That can affect what your next one should be.</p><p> Almost all Xbox One accessories work with the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, so if you already have some controllers or a headset, it makes sense to stick with the same ecosystem.</p><p> Also, if you have digital or physical copies of games, it’s worth checking if you can still play those on the new console.</p><p> The PS5 plays PS4 games, and the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S plays Xbox One games; however, the Switch isn’t backward compatible with the Nintendo Wii U.</p><p><strong>Convenience</strong></p><p> Some consoles are more portable than others. Something like the Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 will live under your TV or next to your monitor and can’t easily be transported elsewhere.</p><p> The Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck work portably and are docked to a screen. It’s worth considering how important portability is for you. Generally, consoles that solely work via a TV or monitor tend to be more powerful, but you miss out on quickly taking it out with you.</p><p> The newest gaming consoles can be pricey, but you don’t have to spend much for an exciting gaming experience. For instance, Nintendo’s consoles, on average, cost about $100 less than many of its competitors. You can also find great deals on classic systems.</p><p> If you’ve previously owned a gaming console, you should consider buying a new one compatible with the library of games you’ve likely collected.</p><p> For example, newer PlayStations won’t play games from older Sony consoles, but you can still access hundreds of older PlayStation titles using the PS Now streaming service.</p><p> On the other hand, Xbox consoles have much better backward compatibility, not to mention a digital redemption scheme that lets you download newer versions of your existing games for free.</p><p> How important is it to you to be able to play your favorite games in true 4K? If your answer is “very,” you’ll want a console that supports 2160p or higher, but if your answer is “not really,” you can settle for something else. The same goes for virtual reality, as not all systems will support it.  </p><p> For more advice,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/before-you-buy-gaming-console-8654423" >read our gaming console buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Other-Consoles-We-Considered"><a href="#Other-Consoles-We-Considered" class="headerlink" title="Other Consoles We Considered"></a>Other Consoles We Considered</h2><ul><li>The<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-Mario-Red/dp/B09NCMZNJK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4154610%7Cnbb55c893b84e43b6a51559b2a372e81214%7C" >Nintendo Switch OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the ultimate Nintendo Switch.

Unfortunately, there is no way to install granular upgrades like you would see with a gaming PC, but you still have the option to increase your storage space or swap its color for something more palatable.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-a-comparison-of-best-linux-screenshare-utilities/"><u>[Updated] A Comparison of Best Linux Screenshare Utilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-create-awe-inspiring-gopro-time-lapse-cinematography-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Create Awe-Inspiring GoPro Time-Lapse Cinematography for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tips-for-gaining-attention-via-snapchat-star/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tips for Gaining Attention via Snapchat Star</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-channeling-creativity-get-green-screen-tips-from-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved Channeling Creativity Get Green Screen Tips From YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quickest-windowed-image-analyzer/"><u>2024 Approved Quickest Windowed Image Analyzer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-why-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s5e-reigns-as-an-android-tablet-king/"><u>Comprehensive Review: Why the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e Reigns as an Android Tablet King</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/elite-selection-of-keyboard-palm-supports-whats-new/"><u>Elite Selection of Keyboard Palm Supports - What's New</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/experience-a-great-convertible-and-inexpensive-asus-chromebook-with-our-detailed-review/"><u>Experience a Great, Convertible & Inexpensive Asus Chromebook with Our Detailed Review!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/experience-next-level-gaming-on-philipss-49-inch-proven-oled-curved-screen/"><u>Experience Next-Level Gaming on Philips's 49-Inch Proven OLED Curved Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/how-do-you-use-your-android-phone-as-a-car-remote-control-with-carkey-feature/"><u>How Do You Use Your Android Phone as a Car Remote Control with CarKey Feature?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-8-vpn-hardware-devices-reviewed-on-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, The Best 8 VPN Hardware Devices Reviewed On Samsung Galaxy S24+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-apple-account-disabled-on-your-apple-iphone-xr-how-to-fix-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Why Apple Account Disabled On your Apple iPhone XR?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Smartwatches are incredible devices, and the Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music is no exception. It’s remarkable how much advanced tech is crammed below the glass of this diminutive device. I ran it through its paces to see if it can stand out in a crowded and competitive niche.</p><h2 id="Design-Attractive-and-minimalistic"><a href="#Design-Attractive-and-minimalistic" class="headerlink" title="Design: Attractive and minimalistic"></a><strong>Design: Attractive and minimalistic</strong></h2><p> At first glance, you could be forgiven for not realizing that the Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Its round, modern, minimalist design is attractive but subtle. The face of the watch is made of scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 3, the case is built of rugged polymer, and the strap is silicone. This rugged construction comes with a waterproofing rating of 5 atmospheres (ATM), which means it’s rated down to 163 feet. However, it’s worth noting that this watch isn’t intended for diving use.</p><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music is operated using both the touch screen and a single button on the side. A short press of the button switches between the app currently in use and the watch face, while a long press brings up a circular menu with shortcuts to menus and apps. Most navigation is controlled via the touchscreen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/M4iaS5RgiaubncJH8F-ZLVQQ8Po=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivoactive-3-Music-Smart-Watch-2-a0cd2c48cc0d423d85a3dc1f7e677160.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087253/19272" target="_top" id="2087253">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087253" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087253/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-On-the-small-side"><a href="#Comfort-On-the-small-side" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: On the small side"></a><strong>Comfort: On the small side</strong></h2><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music is perfectly comfortable if you have small or medium-sized wrists, but the included band was a little small for my extra-large 9-inch wrists. Personally, I couldn’t stand to wear it all day long due to this sizing issue. In order to fully test the watch, I handed it off to a friend with smaller 7-inch wrists, who reported it was extremely comfortable.</p><p> The size of the watch itself is reasonably compact and comparable to larger traditional watches. It weighs only 39 grams, light enough to not feel like a burden.</p><p> The included band was a little small for my extra-large 9-inch wrists.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fairly-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fairly-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fairly straightforward"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fairly straightforward</strong></h2><p> Getting started with the Vivoactive 3 Music is reasonably easy, though it did take me some time after connecting to my phone to get through all the necessary permissions and connections it requires. There were updates to install, and I needed to create an account with Garmin. I also downloaded Spotify and connected the Vivoactive 3 to my wireless earbuds. Note that you need to connect to Wi-Fi to download music via Spotify or another app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134240/18498" target="_top" id="2134240">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134240" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="540" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134240/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Hit-and-miss"><a href="#Performance-Hit-and-miss" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Hit and miss"></a><strong>Performance: Hit and miss</strong></h2><p> When I started using the Vivoactive 3 Music, I found the heart rate monitor to be less than reliable. Sometimes it reported over a hundred BPM while I was sitting on the couch. However, it appears my large wrists are the culprit here, as it reported heart rate more accurately when used by other people with smaller wrists.</p><p> The information collected by the watch can all be found in granular detail in the Garmin Connect app on your phone. The watch has special settings for a wide variety of activities from walking to swimming. It’s quite accurate at distance tracking, step counts, and sleep tracking.</p><p> The 1.2-inch screen has an acceptable resolution of 240 x 240 pixels. It looks fine, and I never had issues with the quality of the image displayed, but it’s quite dim and difficult to see in bright conditions. The touchscreen interface is responsive, though a bit laggy, and it doesn’t always automatically brighten the display when you flip your wrist to check the time.</p><p>The touchscreen interface is responsive, though a bit laggy.</p><h2 id="Battery-Variable-duration"><a href="#Battery-Variable-duration" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Variable duration"></a><strong>Battery: Variable duration</strong></h2><p> How long the battery in the Vivoactive 3 Music lasts depends entirely on how it’s used. If you only use its smartwatch capabilities occasionally then it’s good for a week at a time. However, when I made use of GPS, music, and other power-intensive features, it would run out in less than a full day of use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NdBt6UHu7uQUfRZfJN5BzwIEad8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivoactive-3-Music-Smart-Watch-3-18b432ab56ac4ef284ba74ffd1ec7f82.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Software-Proprietary-ecosystem"><a href="#Software-Proprietary-ecosystem" class="headerlink" title="Software: Proprietary ecosystem"></a><strong>Software: Proprietary ecosystem</strong></h2><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music utilizes Garmin’s proprietary operating system and app store. I was impressed by the wide variety of apps available in the Garmin IQ store. There are numerous downloadable watch faces (I particularly loved one with a Star Trek theme), multiple music apps including Spotify and Amazon Music, maps, tools, and games.</p><p> Though the quality seems to vary, this range of apps opens up a world of customization. I can’t really recommend gaming on the Vivoactive 3 Music though—the screen is just too small, and it’s hard to control anything even as simple as Tetris. However, there are situations where having a simple game on your watch would be really desirable to pass the time, even if it’s hard to control. Keep in mind, though, that games and apps eat away at battery quickly when used actively and frequently.</p><p> You don’t need to lug your phone along with you to use many of the features of this watch.</p><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music also includes<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/most-popular-mobile-payment-apps-2373179" >contactless payment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> through Garmin Pay, which supports a wide range of major cards and banks. It’s a cool feature and is especially desirable from a hygiene perspective as well as for ease and simplicity.</p><p> Of course, the standout feature of the Vivoactive 3 Music is that it can store and play music, which is all that separates the Vivoactive 3 from the Vivoactive 3 Music. It can store up to 500 songs, and I downloaded several albums via Spotify to listen to while out and about. The watch connects to wireless headphones via Bluetooth, which along with the built-in GPS and Wi-Fi means that in many cases you don’t need to lug your phone along with you to use many of the watch’s features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dALT4qb1vS9VNEvePqYoZlqXX0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivoactive-3-Music-Smart-Watch-4-a84ac637f7034353bffd90856070a7d8.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080317/19272" target="_top" id="2080317">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080317" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080317/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Reasonable-value"><a href="#Price-Reasonable-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable value"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable value</strong></h2><p> At its MSRP of $249 the Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music is acceptably priced for the features it packs in.

No, it wasn’t the most powerful headset out there, using a two-year-old smartphone processor to power its games and experiences, but it was a capable, completely self-contained, wireless VR headset that didn’t require a PC or game console to deliver stellar immersion.</p><p> It was one of last year’s greatest new gadgets, and now Oculus has returned with a sequel. The Oculus Quest 2 is smaller and lighter, yet more powerful and with a much better screen—yet it costs $100 less than the original. How did that happen? Well, it’s not all great news, thanks to a couple of cost-cutting measures that you’ll feel and potentially see, but the end result is ultimately a better and more affordable device that serves as an ideal gateway into VR.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Compromises were made"></a>Design and Comfort: Compromises were made</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 sticks to the familiar modern VR playbook as a module that you strap onto your face to immerse yourself within its digital worlds but features some different material and construction choices than the original. Unfortunately, the design choices largely are not upgrades compared to the original headset</p><p> Noticeably, the module itself doesn’t jut out as far from your face as before, plus it has a white plastic finish rather than the black fabric-lined exterior of the original. It also weighs less, which is a good thing for a device that hangs off of your face: it comes in at 503g compared to 571g with the original Quest.</p><p> However, the shallower depth of the module makes an impact for someone like me who must wear glasses while using the Quest 2.</p><p> Even with the included, optional glasses spacer, which adds a couple extra millimeters between the lenses and where the padded visor presses against your face, the inside felt much tighter against my glasses. It can be tricky to get the Quest 2 on without my eyelashes brushing against my lenses.</p><p> But that’s also due in part to the new fabric strap system, which is less effective than the rubber, dome-like strap from the first Quest. That previous strap did a better job of cupping the back of your head to offset the weight of the module itself and keep it comfortably strapped to your head, but these loose, adjustable fabric straps aren’t nearly as secure. It took me longer to get the headset on and in a comfortable position, and I couldn’t find the same kind of sweet spot as before.</p><p> Oculus now sells a $49 Elite Strap attachment that’s more akin to the original Quest strap, and while the Quest 2 straps are usable, I’ll probably make the upgrade and buy the better strap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JkgQv_Sk0ofSL0Sp-jKmqe84xak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-2-a7792535288542dba45c8bc32f882be2.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Rift 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks"><a href="#Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks"></a>Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 uses the same kind of “inside-out” tracking system that relies on four cameras on the visor to track the wireless controllers or even your hands, rather than relying on external tracking sensors as some PC-based systems do. Like the original, it works amazingly well, allowing for fluid, six-degrees-of-freedom movement in games and minimizing both initial setup and the time it takes to get going each session. It also means that you can use the Oculus Quest 2_anywhere_ without the need for any kind of external hardware or accessories.</p><p> The Quest 2’s wireless, motion-sensing Oculus Touch controllers are identical in function to the original, but are a little heavier and have a larger surface with space to rest your thumb when not in use. That’s handy. Each has an analog stick and two face buttons, along with a trigger button and a grip button. Oculus also swapped out the magnetically-attached battery doors from the first Quest controllers—which would sometimes slide open when I used the original—for ones that simply click into place. That’s a win for function over form.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1aG6kdNHMuvnim8p8_i1RwH9QG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-3-eec6cabc11db4ed9be5254aa2bc46ec1.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 "                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> But there is a potential loss for function and comfort with one other particular aspect of the headset itself: IPD adjustment. Inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is the physical distance between your eyes, and a headset must account for it to effectively deliver clear, 3D experiences. On the original Quest, a physical slider let you precisely adjust the distance to match your own face. With the Quest 2, however, there are just three settings, and you can physically shift the placement of the lenses to choose the position that is closest to your own.</p><p> If your IPD matches or is very close to one of the settings (58mm, 63mm, 68mm), then you’re all set. If not, then you may notice that the image isn’t as clear as you’d like, and it could potentially lead to headaches if you can’t find a pretty good sweet spot. In my case, my IPD is close enough to the middle setting to be OK, but it doesn’t feel as spot-on as it did on the original Quest using the slider. It might help knock down the price of the headset, but that’s a quality-of-life downgrade that will affect some people significantly more than others.</p><p> That might sound like a lot of griping, but it’s only because some of the key physical design changes on the Quest 2 feel like compromises or downgrades. But for most people, they won’t be significant impediments. And if you’re coming to the new headset without ever using the original Quest, then you should be fine—the new straps are usable, but they aren’t as effective or effortlessly adjustable as before. Luckily, the Quest 2 makes significant strides elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gwWuuSfTzWNDoS45b-iG9qG32-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-4-27f169e7e71b4372a38e13332b7b1364.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135408/19272" target="_top" id="2135408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135408/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook"></a>Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook</h2><p> You should charge the Oculus Quest 2 out of the box, as the modest total battery life means a partially-charged headset isn’t going to last very long. You will need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either Android or iPhone, and the free Oculus app to complete setup, as well. Once the headset has a good charge, begin setup from the mobile app and then follow the guided directions, which will involve putting on, adjusting, and getting familiar with the headset itself.</p><p> Part of the setup process, and the process each time you use the headset, is to designate your play space by “drawing” a barrier within the augmented view of your surroundings seen through the headset’s cameras. From there, the headset determines whether you have enough space for active, room-scale experiences, or you can choose a stationary setup for seated play modes. During active play, a virtual barrier called the Oculus Guardian appears when you get close to the edges of your designated play space to help you avoid crashing into your surroundings. It’s all rather clever and effective.</p><p> There’s one other potential hitch with the Oculus Quest 2 that wasn’t present with the original: the new headset_requires_ a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610" >Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and there’s no way around it. Facebook owns Oculus, and while the first Quest could be used simply with an Oculus account, the new one requires the social media account. For some, that may be a deal-breaker, given frustrations over privacy and the increasing role that Facebook plays in our society, so just know that going in.</p><h2 id="Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade"><a href="#Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It’s a big upgrade"></a>Performance: It’s a big upgrade</h2><p> The original Oculus Quest did a fine job of delivering immersive VR experiences that didn’t feel compromised or significantly downgraded, even if it didn’t hit the same visual peaks as pricier, PC-powered headsets. And it was pretty amazing that the Quest did so with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a chip found in 2017’s flagship smartphones.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 takes things to another level, and there are a few reasons why.</p><p> First off, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip here is based on the current Snapdragon 865 chip seen in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note20, and is three generations newer than the old chip.</p><p> It’s also paired with 50 percent more RAM (6GB) than the original Quest. Even more vividly, the fast-switching LCD screen packs in nearly 50 percent more pixels per eye than the old OLED panels did, for a noticeably crisper and smoother experience.</p><p> On the first Quest, you got 1440x1600 resolution per eye: solid, but a bit fuzzy and comparatively lower resolution than some of the PC headsets on the market. Here, however, the single screen provides 1832x1920 per eye, and the difference is obvious. While the switch from OLED to LCD technology should weaken the contrast a bit and dampen the deep black levels, I’ll be honest: I didn’t notice.</p><p> What I did notice was sharper interfaces and smoother action, with more fluid-feeling experiences that exhibited fewer of the occasional-yet-tolerable hitches seen with some games and apps on the first Quest headset.</p><p> Additionally, Oculus recently enabled the Quest 2 to hit a peak 90Hz screen refresh rate, up from 72Hz on the first headset, which will only help deliver that smoother-feeling usage. Developers must enable 90Hz within their apps and games, however.</p><p> I felt the Quest 2’s enhancements more prominently in some games over others. Laser sword-swinging music game Beat Saber, for example, ran well on the first headset and isn’t that different here—just smoother and clearer-looking. But with the online battle royale shooter Population: One, the cleaner-looking textures and more fluid performance helped mitigate some of the light motion sickness I felt playing on the first Quest.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones"></a>Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones</h2><p> Plugging in headphones delivers a more closed-off, immersive experience, but the Oculus Quest 2’s built-in speaker does a solid job of delivering audio and music. It does sound a tiny bit louder and fuller than the original Quest’s speaker, but not significantly so. Still, if you want to play without being fully shut-off from your surroundings, it works just fine.</p><h2 id="Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours"><a href="#Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours" class="headerlink" title="Battery: You’ll get a couple hours"></a>Battery: You’ll get a couple hours</h2><p> Like the original headset, the Oculus Quest 2 is rated for 2-3 hours of usage on a full charge. For such a compact, standalone headset, I think that’s reasonable. You get a couple hours to play, and then you can take a breather and do other things while it charges.</p><p> That said, if you’re keen on longer-lasting experiences, Oculus sells a $129 version of the Elite Strap with a built-in battery pack that doubles the play time, or you can get a portable battery pack, plug it in, and stick it in your pocket during use. Lastly, you could just use a lengthy USB-C cable and plug yourself into a wall. If you’re doing room-scale VR games and apps with free movement, however, you’ll need something longer—like 10 feet or more. Otherwise, some seated apps and games will work just fine when you’re tethered to a nearby wall outlet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ns2S3DQVema5UEDDSO8n3N7SC_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-7-0a0e40b6a3064fe7abc985f0900dbeff.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC"><a href="#Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Software: Use the headset or connect to PC"></a>Software: Use the headset or connect to PC</h2><p> The headset’s own interface hasn’t changed much from the first Quest, taking place in a 3D home-like environment with floating menus that you can access via the motion controllers. It’s a pretty easy way to choose between your currently installed games and apps, install anything else in your library, purchase and download new content, and access video content including apps like Netflix, YouTube, and SlingTV.</p><p> Oculus has also enabled optional hand tracking, including the use of hand and finger gestures to get around the interface and interact with some games. Hand tracking is definitely more finicky than using the controllers, however, and you’ll need solid lighting to really rely on it. That said, it does still feel experimental, and I encountered enough misread gestures and incorrect interactions to make me want to stick to the controllers. They work reliably great.</p><p> Since the original Quest’s launch, Oculus added the ability to connect the headset to a powerful PC to run more advanced VR experiences, and that carries over to the Quest 2, as well. You’ll need a PC that is capable of running headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as either the official Oculus Link USB-C cable ($80) or a comparable USB 3.1 cable that can handle the high-speed demands. I bought an unofficial cable for half the price on Amazon, and it worked great.</p><p> Using a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, I was able to play the visually demanding and deeply immersive Half-Life: Alyx on the Oculus Quest 2—a game that it could never run using its own internal hardware. It ran a little less smoothly than it did using the PC-native Valve Index headset, but not significantly so. This is a great way to experience higher-end VR games, including the new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/star-wars-squadrons-review-5086656" >Star Wars: Squadrons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example. And with Oculus announcing plans to phase out PC-only headsets, it will also be a key part of the Quest platform’s future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/72vxixVr7kdKoLfUC3QkIrBl26I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-6-12fcb6054cf2475191bc613a3f26bcfc.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The $299 edition of the headset comes with 64GB of internal storage and the $399 version nets you 256GB, with some of each tally taken up by system software and resources. Luckily, the games and apps themselves aren’t huge, typically weighing in between 1-4GB apiece, sometimes less, and they’re pretty quick to download again if you want to revisit something. The 64GB edition should provide enough space for most players, as you could probably comfortably have a dozen or more games installed, along with streaming media apps, but anyone who wants to have a robust VR library on hand at all times without waiting might consider spending the extra cash.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="701707">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/701707.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-701707">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/701707.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fappsumo.8odi.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F701707%2F7443'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/701707/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Games-A-good-growing-selection"><a href="#Games-A-good-growing-selection" class="headerlink" title="Games: A good, growing selection"></a>Games: A good, growing selection</h2><p> Although those aforementioned games and some others are still only found on PC (or maybe PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 or 5), the Oculus Quest platform has amassed a very nice selection of native games that you can download and play right on the headset.There is no difference in compatibility between the headsets: all Quest games play on Quest 2 and vice versa, just with performance differences.</p><p> Many of the early games from the impressive Quest launch lineup are still among the best games you can play on the Quest 2. The aforementioned Beat Saber, which finds you swinging your controllers to slash faux lightsabers through soaring rhythmic beats, is a frenetic blast, now with a larger library of songs including BTS and Linkin Park packs. Superhot VR is a stylish hybrid of a shooter and a puzzle game, of sorts, as you figure out how to clear through foes while avoiding incoming bullets that only move when you do. Meanwhile, the Star Wars VR game Vader Immortal still does a great job of creating an authentic atmosphere.</p><p> But there’s so much more now, too. Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite, both from developer Enhance Games, are trippy, trancelike experiences that you can sit down and really savor in VR. Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and the aforementioned Population: One show that larger-scale shooter experiences can be immersive and compelling in VR, plus there’s a newer Star Wars game, Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, that blends interactive storytelling with fun blaster battles.</p><p> There’s a lot of great stuff on Quest 2, ranging from simple arcade-like experiences to larger-scale adventures, quirky interactive experiences, and more. And on top of that, there are the aforementioned video services for 360-degree videos, plus fitness apps and games, VR chat for communicating with friends and random people, a web browser, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FqVvo044zoPghSD_PR1g2e0L2rs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-5-216bbf638cbe407b8b6f332abc94ae47.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151871/7443" target="_top" id="2151871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-an-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-It’s-an-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s an amazing value"></a>Price: It’s an amazing value</h2><p> The Oculus Quest was already impressively priced at $399, so launching the more powerful Oculus Quest 2 at $299 is pretty phenomenal. Granted, the design compromises are a little frustrating, and I would’ve rather paid more for a better strap and more precise IPD settings like on the original—but those are the tweaks made to try and broaden the market for the Quest and VR as a whole. Still, even with those design annoyances, the Quest 2 is an incredible value for a portable, fully self-contained VR game console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TDsFPvRGkhZaFzIaNnKRk1_xO4s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-8-Comparison-1b0c51b029da41389167e103a4c4843a.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134489/18498" target="_top" id="2134489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134489/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137413/7443" target="_top" id="2137413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137413/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR"></a>Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR</h2><p> Amazingly, there is no direct analog to the Oculus Quest 2 on the market: Oculus seems to be the only company that can release such a powerful device at this kind of price and with this kind of software support. That said, if I had to compare it to another VR headset, I’d put it up against Sony’s PlayStation VR, which requires a PlayStation 4 or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> console.</p><p> The PSVR is a few years old now and is technically overshadowed by the Quest 2 in terms of screen and controller quality. Still, Sony has amassed some stellar exclusive games thanks to its partnerships with game developers, and the PlayStation VR is a solid, reasonably affordable pickup for anyone who already has a PS4 or PS5 console and wants to dabble in VR. But if you don’t already have the console, and you want to get into VR, go for the dedicated Quest 2 instead. It’ll be cheaper than buying a headset and console together, plus it’s a better VR experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-vr-review-4692684" >Sony PlayStation VR Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best VR device, all things considered.</strong></p><p> The significant performance upgrade and surprising price drop outweigh some of the annoying design shifts with the Oculus Quest 2, making it the must-have VR headset for just about everyone. Not only does it play a great library of on-headset games, but it can also connect to a powerful PC to play even more games on top of that. Add to that the ease of use, quality gameplay, and immersive visuals, and the Oculus Quest 2 is another brilliant VR game console.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975648">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975648.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975648">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975648.png"                      style="border: none;

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135367/19272" target="_top" id="2135367">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135367" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135367/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798161/11305" target="_top" id="798161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798161/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard.

While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123732/7443" target="_top" id="2123732">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123732" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123732/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C302 Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  TopMate</li><li>MPN  C302</li><li>Price  $30.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2016</li><li>Weight  1.09 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.2 x 10.43 x 1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Ports  USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-bio-engineered-healing-spaces-via-arvr/"><u>[New] Bio-Engineered Healing Spaces via AR/VR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-amateurs-to-pros-mastering-mac-audio-in-audacity/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Amateurs to Pros Mastering Mac Audio in Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discover-the-premier-10-vectors-online-stores/"><u>2024 Approved Discover the Premier 10 Vectors Online Stores</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-on-your-realme-11x-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide on Using ADB and Fastboot to Remove FRP Lock on your Realme 11X 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/bright-ideas-in-the-dark-in-depth-analysis-of-the-nook-glowlight-3-from-barnes-and-noble/"><u>Bright Ideas in the Dark: In-Depth Analysis of the Nook GlowLight 3 From Barnes & Noble</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-garmin-venu-analysis-your-ultimate-guide-for-247-wellness-monitoring/"><u>Comprehensive Garmin Venu Analysis - Your Ultimate Guide for 24/7 Wellness Monitoring</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-new-ways-to-boost-your-nes-classic-console-game-selection/"><u>Discover New Ways to Boost Your NES Classic Console Game Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/experience-high-definition-with-the-cost-effective-hisense-50h8f-4k-tv-in-depth-analysis/"><u>Experience High Definition with the Cost-Effective Hisense 50H8F 4K TV: In-Depth Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-lost-ark-cannot-connect-to-the-server-error/"><u>How to Fix Lost Ark “Cannot Connect to the Server” Error</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-send-and-fake-live-location-on-facebook-messenger-of-your-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/iseebell-and-more-uncovering-high-quality-video-door-entry-systems-for-less-than-half-a-hundred-dollars/"><u>ISeeBell and More!

and value, it’s not a big surprise that the ergonomic keyboard wrist rest from Gimars is a popular choice. It’s long enough to pair nicely with any full-sized keyboard or laptop and tall enough to keep your hands at a natural, comfortable elevation level.</p><p> The memory foam material provides plenty of cushion and support for your wrists, slowly bouncing back to its original shape when you lift your hands away. On the bottom, a textured anti-slip gel material keeps the wrist rest from sliding around on your desk, with small circular stickers included to help keep it even more secure.</p><p> Adding to the product’s value is the matching mouse wrist rest. Made of the same soft, breathable material, it’s another valuable accessory for using a mouse with your computer.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Memory foam |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 17x3.4x1 inches</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043593/7443" target="_top" id="2043593">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043593" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043593/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Buy"><a href="#Budget-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Budget Buy"></a>Budget Buy</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ6JWGR?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB07RQ6JWGR" >Yolanda Keyboard Wrist Rest Set <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6gEW_F55hlzg63RbBKHHiqPPnYU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/upgrade-3pcs-gel-memory-foam-keyboard-wrist-rest-support-set-ergonomic-design-easy-typing-pain-relief-for-computer-mac-laptop-home--office-ddea09d1517e412782863d8954c9551a.jpg" >Upgrade 3Pcs Gel Memory Foam Keyboard Wrist Rest Support Set, Ergonomic Design Easy Typing Pain Relief for Computer, Mac Laptop, Home &amp; Office <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ6JWGR?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB07RQ6JWGR" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ6JWGR?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB07RQ6JWGR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ6JWGR?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB07RQ6JWGR" >$10 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Low price</li><li>Mouse pad and mouse wrist rest included</li><li>Comfortable memory foam material</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Potential durability issues over time</li></ul><p> If you’re looking to upgrade your home or office setup on a limited budget, the Yolanda wrist rest set gives you a lot of accessories for your money.

It’s made of lightweight memory foam that feels soft on the wrists and helps them maintain proper positioning when you type. All three parts of the set lie flat without curling up, with non-slip rubber on the base to keep them from shifting around while you use them.</p><p> While durability issues may be an issue after a certain amount of time, most people will get plenty of use for minimal cost.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Memory foam |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 17x3.3x1 inches</p><h2 id="Best-Design"><a href="#Best-Design" class="headerlink" title="Best Design"></a>Best Design</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178FBICI/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB0178FBICI" >Kensington Duo Gel Wrist Rest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AjV8BEfsP7QY2B8f8vxSz9q5Zek=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kensington-duo-gel-keyboard-wrist-rest---blue-k62397am-347fceaaefbf4f7f9951de4a3085fb97.jpg" >Kensington Duo Gel Keyboard Wrist Rest - Blue (K62397AM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178FBICI/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB0178FBICI" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178FBICI/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB0178FBICI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178FBICI/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB0178FBICI" >$18 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/48946320" >$21 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/mouse-pads/78016541?slfpid=3" >$35 at Lenovo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Bold two-color design</li><li>Supportive gel pillows</li><li>Built-in ventilation</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Susceptible to damage</li></ul><p> Most keyboard wrist rests stick with simple, understated designs, but the Kensington Duo Gel Keyboard Wrist Rest quickly catches the eye. It’s constructed with two sleekly curved sections—one black, the other in your choice of blue, red, or gray. The shine of the gel material on the inside helps it stand out even more.</p><p> On the practical side, the split design creates a ventilation channel along the middle of the product, which helps to keep your hands dry and cool as you type away. Most importantly, for a wrist rest, the gel pillow material supports your wrists, holding its shape better than memory foam alternatives that may flatten over time. Thanks to a plastic surface, you can more readily wipe off than fabric coverings; it’s also easier to clean.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Gel |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 19x3.7x1 inches</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Laptops"><a href="#Best-for-Laptops" class="headerlink" title="Best for Laptops"></a>Best for Laptops</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QZ6KCRG?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08QZ6KCRG" >AQUUES WavePads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Iwqn4bSRwu8m8NBjBhbfndJXYU8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/wavepads-by-aquues-solutions--two-pack-non-slip-wrist-rests-for-laptop-and-keyboard-ergonomic-memory-foam-laptop-wrist-pads-for-wrist-pain--carpal-cb129c52fb544c708b57063d637b5a53.jpg" >WavePads by AQUUES Solutions &acirc; Two Pack Non-Slip Wrist Rests for Laptop and Keyboard Ergonomic Memory Foam Laptop Wrist Pads for Wrist Pain &amp; Carpal… <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QZ6KCRG?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08QZ6KCRG" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QZ6KCRG?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08QZ6KCRG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QZ6KCRG?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08QZ6KCRG" >$25 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://postureupshop.com/products/wavepads" >View on Postureupshop.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Cleverly designed for laptop use</li><li>Easy to reposition and travel with</li><li>Usable with any keyboard or mouse</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>May not stay in place enough</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><p> Just about any keyboard wrist rest can work with a laptop by positioning it in front of the machine.

They consist of two squares of high-density memory foam on either side of the trackpad, providing support and comfort right where your wrists naturally fall when you type on your laptop keyboard.</p><p> Non-stick surfaces on the base of the WavePads help keep them in place (though you might experience some slipping). These won’t leave residue on your laptop without any adhesive materials.</p><p> You can reposition them or even pick them up to take on the go, and you can use the provided elegant metal clip to carry them neatly while traveling. The portable, versatile nature of the WavePads also makes them great wrist rests for an external keyboard or mouse, not just laptops.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Memory foam |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 3.5x3.5x0.625 inches (x2)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-extended-mouse-pads-4584491" >The Best Extended Mouse Pads of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-the-Office"><a href="#Best-for-the-Office" class="headerlink" title="Best for the Office"></a>Best for the Office</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXLQPJ2?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08KXLQPJ2" >JEDIA Keyboard Wrist Rest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zGicznN9PgIqmg9YGshKQte_g9A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/jedia-keyboard-wrist-rest-6acf3b87508348af9841a85f283a0fa3.jpg" >JEDIA Keyboard Wrist Rest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXLQPJ2?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08KXLQPJ2" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXLQPJ2?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08KXLQPJ2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXLQPJ2?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08KXLQPJ2" >$19 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Supportive, ergonomic memory foam</li><li>Compact and low-profile</li><li>Ventilated surface</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>More flat and narrow than most options</li><li>Simplistic design</li></ul><p> JEDIA’s unassuming but adequate keyboard wrist rest is excellent for most workplaces.

Fray-resistant stitching around the outside edges boosts its durability, while non-slip rubber on the bottom holds it on your desk.</p><p> While gaming-specific gear often comes with flashy aesthetics and premium price tags, the HyperX wrist rest sports more of a minimalist design and a reasonable cost.

Its gel feels somewhat firmer than other gel wrist rests, finding a happy medium between softness and support. It quickly bounces back into its original shape after you remove your hands, though it doesn’t hold up well to direct pressure from your elbows.</p><p> It also hits a nice balance with its cover material, which avoids the downsides of sticky plastic and absorbent fabric. The surface is smooth, satiny, and easy to wipe clean. Sizing is another aspect the 3M wrist rest gets right. Its 19-inch length works with just about any keyboard, while its narrow width and low profile make it easy to fit even in tight desk spaces.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Gel |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 19x1.9x0.60 inches</p><h2 id="Best-for-Mechanical-Keyboards"><a href="#Best-for-Mechanical-Keyboards" class="headerlink" title="Best for Mechanical Keyboards"></a>Best for Mechanical Keyboards</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Wood-Keyboard-Wrist-Wooden/dp/B01NBGZIII/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB01NBGZIII" >Glorious Gaming Wooden Wrist Rest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TRVBefu2jpU3aFTC7a5z2n-Gwrk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/glorious-gaming-wooden-wrist-rest---compact---brown---mechanical-keyboards-wood-ergonomic-palm-rest-12x4-inches19mm-thick-gv-75-brown-ece72fc9edcd4238bc03c1e73ea7443c.jpg" >Glorious Gaming Wooden Wrist Rest - Compact - Brown - Mechanical Keyboards Wood Ergonomic Palm Rest| 12x4 inches&#x2F;19mm Thick (GV-75-BROWN) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Wood-Keyboard-Wrist-Wooden/dp/B01NBGZIII/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB01NBGZIII" >https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Wood-Keyboard-Wrist-Wooden/dp/B01NBGZIII/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB01NBGZIII <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Wood-Keyboard-Wrist-Wooden/dp/B01NBGZIII/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB01NBGZIII" >$30 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-wood-keyboard-wrist-rest" >View on Gloriousgaming.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Comfortable and ergonomic</li><li>Durable</li><li>Unique, elegant style</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Hard material not for everyone</li><li>On the pricey side</li></ul><p> Those preferring to type with more responsive, “clicky” physical keys can opt for a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mechanical-keyboard-2640212" >mechanical keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead of a membrane keyboard that provides minimal tactile feedback. Mechanical keyboards call for a particular wrist rest to go with it, and that’s where the wooden wrist rest from Glorious Gaming can shine.</p><p> The white ash wood material isn’t soft like foam or gel and won’t suit everyone. However, it still provides the ergonomic positioning and comfort that wrist rests offer, especially for mechanical keyboards. A protective coating keeps the top surface smooth and sweat-resistant, and rubber pads underneath prevent slippage.</p><p> The Glorious Gaming wooden rests come in various lengths, designed to fit full-size keyboards, smaller tenkeyless models (without a number pad), and even smaller compact sizes. There’s even a size meant for use with a mouse.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : White Ash Hardwood |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 17.5x4x0.75 inches</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-in-a-Keyboard-Wrist-Rest"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-in-a-Keyboard-Wrist-Rest" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in a Keyboard Wrist Rest"></a>What to Look for in a Keyboard Wrist Rest</h2><h3 id="Material"><a href="#Material" class="headerlink" title="Material"></a>Material</h3><p> The material determines how comfortable a rest feels, how much support it provides, and how it positions your wrists—depending on your preferences. Many products use soft memory foam padding covered with fabric. Others use a cooler, squishier gel material within a smooth surface like plastic. More rarely, you may find wrist rests with leather surfaces or made of hardwood. It often comes down to trying out a product and seeing how it feels for you.</p><h3 id="Size-and-Shape"><a href="#Size-and-Shape" class="headerlink" title="Size and Shape"></a>Size and Shape</h3><p> Because a wrist rest should guide your body into a particular position, its size, and shape are essential on a functional level. A flatter wrist rest might put your hands at just the right height for your keyboard, or you may need a taller one to keep your wrists more elevated. If you use a compact keyboard or a tenkeyless (TKL) one that doesn’t include a full number pad, you might want a shorter wrist rest that matches closer to that size. Most keyboard wrist rests also work for laptops.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082533/7443" target="_top" id="2082533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Durability"><a href="#Durability" class="headerlink" title="Durability"></a>Durability</h3><p> It may be hard to gauge a wrist rest’s durability or how long it will last you, but generally, you’ll pay more for higher-quality construction and materials. Foam can flatten or deform, and gel pillows can be punctured. Some exterior surfaces are easier to clean and maintain than others, and some may have covers with reinforced stitching. Wooden wrist rests are as durable as they get, at the expense of softness.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >The Best Ergonomic Keyboards of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Is a keyboard wrist rest necessary?<br> While anyone can use a keyboard without one, wrist rests offer a lot of comfort and wellness benefits, especially for people who type or play computer games for long periods. Keeping your hands too high or too low, in addition to the repetitive motions, can lead to fatigue, wrist strain, and issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Wrist rests help support your wrists and keep them in a more natural position to avoid those concerns.</li><li>How do I clean my keyboard wrist rest?<br> Wrist rests can gather dirt, oils, and other stains, but fortunately, most have easy-to-clean coverings or surfaces. Gel pads with plastic or similar smooth exteriors are the simplest to wipe off with a damp cloth or sponge. Foam wrist rests tend to use covers made from fabric, which may require some vacuuming or a bit of detergent, depending on the level of dirt or staining. Generally, you should avoid washing machines and dishwashers since they usually ruin the product.</li><li>Should I choose a gel or foam keyboard wrist rest?<br> It’s a matter of preference. Memory foam wrist rests are more common—they offer soft padding that contours somewhat to the shape of your wrist, but they may stay more flattened over time. Gel wrist rests are squishy, bounce back to shape quickly, and help keep your hands cool. Some users don’t like the plastic surfaces they usually come with, though, and sharp objects may puncture and compromise the gel. If these common types don’t work for you, alternative materials like leather and wood are also available.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-effortless-film-logging-how-to-use-devices-like-pros-for-2024/"><u>[New] Effortless Film Logging How to Use Devices Like Pros for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-proven-techniques-to-swell-your-social-media-following/"><u>[New] In 2024, Proven Techniques to Swell Your Social Media Following</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-scripts-to-subscribers-mastering-the-production-of-engaging-educational-videos-for-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved From Scripts to Subscribers Mastering the Production of Engaging Educational Videos for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-accelerate-your-audience-size-the-best-apps-on-androidiphone-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Accelerate Your Audience Size The Best Apps on Android/iPhone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/analyzing-the-viair-88p-handheld-compressor-immense-capabilities-minor-flaws-revealed/"><u>Analyzing the Viair 88P Handheld Compressor: Immense Capabilities, Minor Flaws Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/easy-guide-to-updating-your-vga-drivers-fetch-them-here/"><u>Easy Guide to Updating Your VGA Drivers – Fetch Them Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/expand-and-strengthen-home-internet-with-the-netgear-nighthawk-x6s-router-range-extender/"><u>Expand and Strengthen Home Internet with the Netgear Nighthawk X6S Router Range Extender</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-or-downgrade-iphone-11-without-losing-data-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Upgrade or Downgrade iPhone 11 Without Losing Data? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ring-youtube-shorts-for-profit-essential-requirements-and-potential-earnings/"><u>Mastering Youtube Shorts for Profit Essential Requirements and Potential Earnings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/navigating-the-pre-owned-ipad-market-a-buyers-checklist-of-5-key-points/"><u>Navigating the Pre-Owned iPad Market: A Buyer’s Checklist of 5 Key Points</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/revolutionize-your-clicks-the-elite-selection-of-wireless-and-wired-mac-mice-2024-edition/"><u>Revolutionize Your Clicks: The Elite Selection of Wireless & Wired Mac Mice - 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/solutions-to-spy-on-nokia-c300-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Solutions to Spy on Nokia C300 with and without jailbreak | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/top-rated-ups-power-solutions-ultimate-protection/"><u>Top-Rated UPS Power Solutions: Ultimate Protection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/tp-link-archer-c9-review-a-favorite-budget-router/"><u>TP-Link Archer C9 Review: A Favorite Budget Router</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/visual-perfection-top-rated-online-printing-providers-for-24/"><u>Visual Perfection: Top-Rated Online Printing Providers for '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/why-is-ipogo-not-working-on-google-pixel-8-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Why is iPogo not working On Google Pixel 8?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses roughly the same design as many of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, and it didn’t give the absolute best results either. Nonetheless, it’s still going to be the best choice for a really large segment of buyers out there simply because of how aggressively its priced.</p><p> If you are living inside of a large metropolitan area, you likely don’t need the best possible antenna to pick up the channels being broadcast to you over the air. Furthermore, I didn’t see that big of a difference in performance as price increased. Unless you step it all the way up to a much larger, much more expensive solution, the difference in performance is probably not worth it, which is why the 1byone is an easy recommendation. Let’s see how it performed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FEdsHVNn7IxwxXsSkRT0jxmmRuQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_02-d797d473ec154becbab8a3023cff8b53.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886069/19272" target="_top" id="1886069">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886069" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886069/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Vanilla"><a href="#Design-Vanilla" class="headerlink" title="Design: Vanilla"></a><strong>Design: Vanilla</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses a flat rectangular design similar to other powered indoor antennas on the market. The 13.25 x 9.25 inch antenna surface is roughly in line with most of the other products I looked at in this category, the only real difference being that the 1byone has a much more rigid surface.</p><p> Being a powered antenna, the 1byone uses an external amplifier to boost the signal. This box contains a coaxial input attached via the included 16.5ft cable, and has a power input, which can be supplied by the TV itself if it can support USB power. Otherwise, 1byone includes a USB power adapter.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fairly-intuitive"><a href="#Setup-Fairly-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fairly intuitive"></a><strong>Setup: Fairly intuitive</strong></h2><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas. Simply attach the 16.5ft coaxial cable to the external amplifier, connect the power to a USB power source, and then attach the coaxial cable from the amplifier to your TV.</p><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Performance-Good-enough-for-most"><a href="#Performance-Good-enough-for-most" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Good enough for most"></a><strong>Performance: Good enough for most</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna didn’t have the best performance of the antennas we’ve tested, falling somewhere in the middle of the pack. In my channel acquisition test, I averaged 59 channels across all the tests performed. This compares to the worst performing antenna at just 47, and the best at 76.</p><p> This should be more than suitable for most people living within a city in relatively close proximity to the source of the TV signal. As for those living further, your mileage may vary.</p><h2 id="Range-Middle-of-the-road"><a href="#Range-Middle-of-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Range: Middle of the road"></a><strong>Range: Middle of the road</strong></h2><p> 1byone makes no specific promises about the range of their antenna, although they do cite users having positive experiences from as far as 48 miles away in their customer testimonials. Given how many factors impact the effective range, I think it is somewhat wise not to make any promises. Nonetheless, this is clearly a device that will be best suited for people living in or near major metropolitan areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6y-ITpY8n7xf8BteMqdJjYm-paU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_05-178a02351af040cc89c86169b88a6de2.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-A-great-deal"><a href="#Price-A-great-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great deal"></a><strong>Price: A great deal</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna costs just $25, making it the least expensive option out of the antennas I tested. It picked up all the major channels that I would actually watch, and didn’t have any issues with the signal. So from my perspective, why would I pay more? I think buyers would probably be best served by seeing if an antenna like this works for them. If you discover you need something more substantial, feel free to move on to a pricier option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139123/17108" target="_top" id="2139123">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139123" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139123/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna"><a href="#1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna"></a><strong>1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Another popular manufacturer is Mohu, and the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna offers a simpler, non-amplified solution that only loses out on a hair of performance versus the 1byone. I preferred the build quality of the Mohu Leaf, if only marginally, and like the simplicity of not needing additional wires and boxes hanging out of my TV.</p><p> At the end of the day though, the 1byone performs better and costs less money, so it’s not the easiest argument to make.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The overall best value.</strong></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna offers the best value out of all the indoor antennas that we tested.

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> If you use your laptop for playing games or running high-performance apps, then you’ve probably seen it get very warm and kick on its potentially loud internal fans. However, the built-in fans can only do so much to dissipate the immense heat built within, try as they might. That’s where laptop cooling pads come in, blasting additional cool air into your laptop to help take down the internal and external temperatures.</p><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.</p><p> Kootek’s Laptop Cooling Pad isn’t the cheapest option around, nor is it the most premium—but it’s effective and sells for a reasonable price, and is large enough to accommodate larger laptops with 17-inch displays. A clunky height adjustment system is the main drawback, but it doesn’t stop the Kootek pad from working as expected.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924297/11305" target="_top" id="924297">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924297" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/924297/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Clunky-but-it-works"><a href="#Design-Clunky-but-it-works" class="headerlink" title="Design: Clunky, but it works"></a>Design: Clunky, but it works</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a larger unit, measuring nearly 15 inches wide, 11.8 inches tall, and about 1.4 inches thick, with a weight of 2.6 pounds. It’s heavier and bulkier than the lightweight TopMate C302 Cooling Pad, for example, and feels more durable as a result.</p><p> It’s built for laptops with screens between 12 and 17 inches diagonal, with a wide metal grate on the surface to help dissipate heat as the five fans blow onto your laptop. Most of the rest of the build is plastic. Each fan has red LED lighting for an added glow to the pad.</p><p> The height adjustment system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution.</p><p> Two flip-up, padded stoppers at the bottom of the surface help keep your laptop in place even when you have the pad angled, thanks to the height adjustment system. Granted, that system is easily my least favorite part of this cooling pad.</p><p> Essentially, there’s a loose metal bar hanging from the main unit of the cooling pad, and you’ll slot that into one of six ridges on the bottom stand to prop it up. The system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution. It works and it provides finer-grain height adjustment levels, but it feels like a clunky solution for a tech accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Uuby879oWyaUH6_3WN7ZssAF-g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_04-73dc23f85de34fa087b21b21461f9f74.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> There are two buttons at the back of the pad: One button controls the large, central fan (4.72 inches), while the other controls the four smaller fans (2.76 inches each). I’m not sure why you would choose to use only some fans at any given time, since they’re all quiet, but the option is there if you want it. You’ll also find two USB-A ports, meaning this cooling pad functions as a hub for plugging additional accessories into your laptop.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Very-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Very-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Very straightforward"></a>Setup Process: Very straightforward</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad doesn’t require any software or its own power unit to function. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the height as desired, and then plug the built-in USB cable into your laptop to power it on. As mentioned, you can control the fans using the buttons at the back of the pad, and the USB ports can be used for additional accessories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A5iJ3c7mD8guT4DKXitqb3wlp6I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_03-9ec8e6afd494441f8ae20c38ae1fadbb.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902273/19272" target="_top" id="1902273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902273/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-Cool-and-quiet"><a href="#Performance-Cool-and-quiet" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Cool and quiet"></a>Performance: Cool and quiet</h2><p> I tested the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , featuring an Intel Core i7-9750H processor with 16GB RAM, along with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB). It’s a solidly powerful gaming laptop, and I put it to the test with a couple of popular games as well as a graphics benchmark test.</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid impact in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite.</p><p> I recorded the internal temperature using NZXT’s CAM app and the external temperature with a infrared thermometer, first with the laptop by itself. After it cooled down, I tested again with the cooling pad equipped the whole time.</p><p> In racing game Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade put up an internal processor temperature of 184 degrees Fahrenheit and external temperature of 117 degrees, but peaked at 169 degrees internal and 107 degrees external with the Kootek pad equipped. The average frame rate was nearly identical between tests, with no significant difference from the use of the cooling pad.</p><p> Meanwhile, I saw a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees when playing Fortnite, along with an external temperature of 118 degrees. With the cooling pad equipped, I saw a slightly lower internal peak of 192 degrees, although it mostly hovered in the 160 to 170-degree range during testing. The external peak with the Kootek pad was 106 degrees. Curiously, I saw the exact same numbers with the Heaven graphics benchmark test with and without the cooling pad: 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees external.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ppFnQ9kEpjbEV9cYbHzLRI5j-j8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_05-4a4d5ee065a94c3e984ae0c96f4916d8.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1160850">                    <video width="576" height="324" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1160850">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1160850%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1160850/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid effort in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite, although the cheaper, dual-fan TopMate C302 cooling pad saw slightly better overall results. Your experience may vary depending on your laptop of choice, however. All the while, the Kootek pad stayed pretty quiet in stark contrast to the Razer Blade’s own very loud internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134235/18498" target="_top" id="2134235">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134235" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134235/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Entirely-reasonable"><a href="#Price-Entirely-reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Entirely reasonable"></a>Price: Entirely reasonable</h2><p> At $26 from Amazon, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.

It’s designed for laptops up to 15 inches in size and isn’t quite as thick or heavy, but it gets the job done with effective cooling and straightforward design. Kootek’s pad offers an additional USB port for accessories, though, and allows for more height variance than the TopMate’s basic pop-out feet.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good all-around option.</strong></p><p> A clunky design makes the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad a bit awkward in use, but ultimately it does a solid job of cooling hot laptops and accommodating larger-sized devices. The extra USB ports are handy, especially for port-limited laptops, and the price is reasonable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012434/19272" target="_top" id="2012434">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012434" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012434/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  Kootek</li><li>MPN  LCP05</li><li>Price  $35.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2018</li><li>Weight  2.91 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15 x 11.8 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Ports  USB-A x2</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ensuring-transparency-in-video-creator-incomes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Ensuring Transparency in Video Creator Incomes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-transform-your-vids-for-social-scenes-with-tunes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Transform Your Vids for Social Scenes With Tunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/benchmarking-performance-a-closer-look-at-the-open-source-capabilities-of-the-linksys-wrt1900acs/"><u>Benchmarking Performance: A Closer Look at the Open-Source Capabilities of the Linksys WRT1900ACS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-linksys-ac1900-max-stream-wifi-router-perfect-choice-for-all-homes/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of Linksys AC1900 Max-Stream WiFi Router: Perfect Choice for All Homes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/game-on-in-style-experience-unmatched-support-with-the-mavix-m9-chair/"><u>Game On in Style: Experience Unmatched Support with the Mavix M9 Chair</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-unlocking-secrets-of-s-pen-and-dex-modes/"><u>How to Get the Most Out of Your Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 – Unlocking Secrets of S Pen and DeX Modes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-honor-x9b-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Honor X9b to Other Android Devices?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129042/19576" target="_top" id="2129042">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129042" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129042/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><h2 id="Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs"><a href="#Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs"></a><strong>Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs</strong></h2><p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030380/11832" target="_top" id="1030380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030380/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market. Indeed, at that price, it’s the least expensive one we tested, yet no part of it feels like any corners were cut in terms of quality or performance.</p><p> At that price point, it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><h2 id="Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme"><a href="#Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme" class="headerlink" title="Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme"></a><strong>Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme</strong></h2><p><strong><em>DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter:</em></strong>  When it comes down to it these two units are surprisingly similar, down to the case and overall design of the unit. If you really want the ability to use your jump starter to also charge your laptop the DBPOWER is worth a look. Otherwise, save yourself around $10 and stick with the Beatit BT-D11.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dbpower-djs50-jump-starter-review-4783966" >DBPOWER Portable Car Jump Starter Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong><em>M MOOCK 1000A Peak 18000mAh Car Jump Starter:</em></strong>  This is another case of asking yourself how much you need the option to charge a laptop. The M MOOCK jump starter can but is also roughly $8 more. Its case is more of a flat square as well, so it slides more easily under seats.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144274/7443" target="_top" id="2144274">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144274" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144274/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100529/7443" target="_top" id="2100529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134502/19576" target="_top" id="2134502">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134502" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="672" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134502/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144297/7443" target="_top" id="2144297">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144297" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144297/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896510/19272" target="_top" id="1896510">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896510" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896510/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148643/16836" target="_top" id="2148643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="75"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148643/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123730/7443" target="_top" id="2123730">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123730" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123730/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062450/7443" target="_top" id="1062450">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062450" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062450/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-screen-recorders-showdown-apowersoft-among-them/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Screen Recorders Showdown Apowersoft Among Them</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-your-cover-videos-pull-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhancing Your Cover Video's Pull for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-digital-worlds-revealed-metaverse-vs-multiverse/"><u>[Updated] Digital Worlds Revealed Metaverse vs Multiverse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/9-best-free-android-monitoring-apps-to-monitor-phone-remotely-for-your-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>9 Best Free Android Monitoring Apps to Monitor Phone Remotely For your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/budget-buys-premium-v770-outlook/"><u>Budget Buys, Premium V770 Outlook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-bandsmith-sandisks-portable-music-box/"><u>Budget-Friendly Bandsmith -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The original Xbox One controller has undergone quite a few changes and iterations over the console’s long life. You’ve got the original version that launched with the Xbox One, a slightly updated version of that, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-s-controller-review-4770950" >One S controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and then the Elite. Each of these controllers were pretty well-received in their day, but Microsoft carefully improved and updated them throughout the years to make them even better.</p><p> We reviewed the original $150 Elite controller when it debuted years ago and loved nearly every aspect of it, but it wasn’t flawless suffering from the lack of a few key features and some durability issues. This is where the newly updated Elite Series 2 controller comes in. Listening to feedback provided by gamers on the weaknesses of Series 1, Microsoft has put out what is likely to be the last iteration of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-consoles-4156250" >Xbox One controller, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it’s pretty much perfect—provided you’re willing to pay the hefty price tag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/t8wI_yN2s_uIQ1leo87MmOnXxb4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-5-0c39ec4e89eb45b094471681efec0e7d.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016134/19272" target="_top" id="2016134">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016134" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016134/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed"><a href="#Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed" class="headerlink" title="Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed"></a><strong>Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed</strong></h2><p> The general format of the Elite Series 2 takes the basic XB1 controller and builds upon that excellent design by adding in tons of extras and features. However, unlike the first Elite controller, this version uses the newer One S model controller as its basis. This means there is no more two-piece design where the top and bottom shells of the controller are separate. The build is less flashy perhaps, no longer sporting a two-tone finish, but it makes it feel much more solid and creates a sleeker look.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout. The original Elite used brushed aluminum as an accent tone, but that’s been swapped for a darker gunmetal finish that I personally love. This accent tone is found along the top bumpers and triggers (that are now textured plastic), as well as the analog sticks and Xbox&#x2F;home button. You’ll also notice that the mini<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the top is now USB Type-C. Aside from my personal dream of this USB port becoming the universal design for all electronics, this implementation offers a superior port with better data transfer speeds and quicker charging times, so it’s nice to see here.</p><p> The grips this time have been heavily revamped (a welcome change as they were a point of weakness for durability on the Series 1), wrapping around the back, sides, and front for a seamless texture. Also changed from the previous Elite, these grips are no longer grey, but instead a nice black tone to match the rest of this black beauty.</p><p> For the face of the Series 2, the four iconic Xbox buttons are unchanged, but there are a few small changes elsewhere. The toggle switch from the Series 1 has now been swapped for a simple push-button that allows you to toggle between premade profiles with even more flexibility. It is easier to accidentally push, but we didn’t find it to be an issue.</p><p> One of the most striking changes to this area is the D-pad, which no longer sticks out from the design with its shiny aluminum surface. This time around, it’s sporting a flat black color that meshes much better with the overall look of the Series 2. It’s still got the radar-dish design that I personally find to be one of the best D-pad designs for any controller ever made.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout.</p><p> The rear of the Series 2 is slightly different from its predecessor, mainly the lack of a removable battery. Now this change is a bit polarizing for two main reasons. A rechargeable battery is super convenient since you can simply plug it in and juice it up, never having to worry about scrambling around for new batteries. On the other hand, this battery, like all rechargeable batteries, will ultimately wear down and eventually need replacing, which you can no longer do on your own. Much like smartphones that have ditched removable batteries, it seems like more and more devices are forgoing that option. We personally love the rechargeable pack included and supposedly it’ll last 10 years, but when it does get worn out, your only option is to send it in to have Microsoft replace it.</p><p> There is also a minimal charging strip where the battery sits, allowing you to use the included dock plugged into your USB-C cord to charge the controller when not in use. This dock is an excellent perk of the Series 2, negating the need for third-party docks that are often plagued with issues. I found it convenient to leave this dock plugged into the Xbox all the time so that I could place the controller there for a quick charge between gaming sessions or at the end of the night.</p><p> Battery aside, the rear of the Series 2 also features the optional paddles and extra buttons if you like to use those for added customization. The only difference with these is the finish, which now matches the dark tone of the D-pad. Lastly, the hair triggers return, but now have three different settings instead of two, providing even more potential customizing.</p><p> The final part of the design we’d like to discuss is the case. The first Elite also included a case, but this too has been refreshed for the Series 2. The first thing of note is that it isn’t quite the same case just rehashed. Close inspection shows that the material has also been changed a bit, making it smoother and less scratchy. The zipper also uses the new gunmetal finish. One of the more important changes to the case is that the top now includes a port for the charging dock, so you can even charge your controller right inside the case.</p><p> Inside the case, the material has also been swapped from grey to black to continue the darker theme of the Series 2. You’ll also notice the foam pad is no longer here, as that’s where the dock sits. This dock can be removed or used inside the case and attaches with a strong magnet. The last two parts of the case are unchanged from Series 1, with a mesh cradle for accessories on the top and a foam organizer to hold all the swappable thumbsticks and paddles when not in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TRrezKVbAUPs2Rud3g4_iOHyxB8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-2-4b3f9d8acd1440089989378253d902f4.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036486/19272" target="_top" id="2036486">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036486" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036486/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy"><a href="#Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy"></a><strong>Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy</strong></h2><p> The original Elite was perhaps the most comfortable controller I’ve ever used, so with the Series 2, I had high hopes in this department. Thanks to some clever but subtle changes by the Microsoft team, this controller is even better.</p><p> The main points of ergonomic superiority the Elite has over the cheaper XB1 controllers stem from the finish, grips and sheer customization that allows each user to tailor their controller to their preference. With so many options between different combinations of thumbsticks, D-pads, and paddles, everyone can find their optimal setup after some experimenting.</p><p> The grips are perhaps the most important part of this realm since that’s where your hands will be in contact with the controller most of the time. Luckily, they’re even better on the Series 2. While the original Elite only had rubberized grips along the back, the Series 2 has them wrapped around the full circumference of the device. This means your hands rest on them completely, providing a nice grippy surface that never gets slippery.</p><p> The last point of comfort I appreciated on the Series 2 is the textured triggers. While somewhat gimmicky, I found it to be better suited for quickly identifying between the triggers and bumpers, similar to how the home row on your keyboard has bumps on it.</p><p> The only real issue some users may see as a downside of this controller is that it’s quite a hefty device. The controller weighs 348 grams with all attachments, so it might take some getting used to compared to the 210 gram S controller. I personally love the bulk, as it feels premium, but it might not be for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cS5fpyPSlqvyETs-nGxTtAB3vXU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-4-070b6c59b206457ba1068704bbe7bca9.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last"></a><strong>Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last</strong></h2><p> One of our biggest gripes with the original Elite controller was that it lacked Bluetooth functionality despite its premium price tag. Seeing how the much cheaper ONE S variant included this, it was even more frustrating. Thankfully, Microsoft listened to our collective rants and added Bluetooth to the Series 2, which drastically improves the number of devices it can be used with.</p><p> The overall setup process for the new Series 2 is quick and simple (more so than the first Elite). So let’s cover how to use it with both your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and PC. First things first, make sure the rechargeable battery is sufficiently charged (it comes charged out of the box) and you’re ready to pair it with the console.</p><p> To do so, turn on your console first and wait for it to fully boot. Now power on the controller and hold down the pairing button on the top until the Xbox symbol flashes. Then do the same thing on your console’s pairing button until both begin to rapidly flash (this indicates they are searching for each other). Once paired, the flashing will slow and then stop completely to show they have successfully paired.</p><p> As we stated earlier, the inclusion of Bluetooth means using the Series 2 with your PC is even easier than previous<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/games-console-reviews-4102640" >Xbox One controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For those who plan to use their Elite Series 2 with a PC, this is perhaps the single best upgrade over the Series 1, because you no longer need the annoyingly large adapter to pair it with your PC (also saving you an additional $25).</p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC.</p><p> To do this, first ensure your PC is running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and your controller is also updated. Next, you can turn on the controller and head to the computer. At your desktop, select Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices, then turn Bluetooth on so it can discover the controller. After doing so, you should see “Xbox Wireless Controller” pop up, and you can now click “pair” from there and you’re ready to game.</p><p> For those who want to use their PC for local multiplayer games, it should also be noted that you can only connect one Bluetooth controller to your PC at a time. In addition to that limitation, you also can’t use any attachments like headsets, chat pads or the stereo adapter in this mode.</p><p> If you plan to buy this controller to use with other electronics that support Bluetooth devices, make sure you do some research before committing to it, as it doesn’t always work with everything. That said, we did manage to pair the controller with a couple other devices that weren’t officially supported.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v25KBj3XhkgWMjFaqVnLVUUJqSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-3-29dc70adabc64f888db60e817695153f.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability"><a href="#Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability" class="headerlink" title="Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability"></a><strong>Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability</strong></h2><p> To test the performance of the new Elite Series 2 controller, I put this device through several hours of gaming on both PC and Xbox One platforms running a number of games and layouts. The results were promising, so let’s take a closer look.</p><p> Enhanced performance in games is one of the big selling points of the Elite, which is marketed towards players who want to gain an advantage over those with regular controllers. While subtle, I did feel that the Elite improved some small aspects of my gameplay, though skill trumps this in every way.</p><p> For things like shooters, the hair triggers will give you a slight increase to reaction time, as there is less pull, but it takes some getting used to. The longer thumbsticks supposedly help with things like aim time, but getting used to them requires a bit of relearning to get the muscle memory rewired. Personally, I prefer the shorter sticks, but to each their own.</p><p> The paddles are great for adding additional functionality to your controller that non-Elite controllers can’t touch. For racing games like Forza, using these to shift gears means you can do so without having to move your fingers from other buttons. However, because these are unique to the Elite controllers, new users will have a steep learning curve to successfully implement them into their gameplay.</p><p> This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console.</p><p> The enhanced D-pad is perhaps my favorite piece of kit to instantly improve gaming performance. For things like platformers or fighting games, the dish design is exceptionally good at helping you to nail combos or tricky movements, and I always have it equipped.</p><p> No matter what games we used the Series 2 with, from Destiny 2 to Dragon Ball Fighter Z and more, we felt the controller added a subtle but noticeable boost to performance over a regular controller. That being said, it won’t drastically make you better, so don’t get your hopes up.</p><p> In terms of durability, this new Series 2 addresses several weaknesses of the Series 1. The rubber grips used to be a particularly weak point, coming unglued from the body over time. It seems like Microsoft have fixed this, but only time will tell.</p><p> The bumpers on every XB1 controller up until the One S were another point of failure due to the thin plastic piece that attached them to the controller. If you dropped your controller in just the right spot, even from a short height, they often broke and flopped around, requiring you to either send it in for repair or fix it yourself at home. The original Elite also suffered from this, and I experienced this with my first device. Now that the Series 2 is built off the S controller, this is supposedly no longer an issue.</p><p> While we didn’t experience any durability issues with our controller, the long-term durability will need to be assessed at a later date, though it seems to have gotten some upgrades to resolve issues of the past.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1883998/19272" target="_top" id="1883998">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1883998" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1883998/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console"><a href="#Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console" class="headerlink" title="Price: Like buying a brand new console"></a><strong>Price: Like buying a brand new console</strong></h2><p> Right now, the Elite Series 2 controller retails at an MSRP of $249.99, about $100 more than its predecessor. This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console (or three brand new titles). That can be a tough sell for your average gamer.</p><p> Sure, all of the included extras, customization potential, and the ultra-premium feel is nice, but does that warrant the cost? Well, that’s for you to decide ultimately, but if you do plan on fully utilizing the customization potential, it’s probably worth it. Otherwise, the One S is probably sufficient.</p><p> The argument could be made that considering you get a Bluetooth controller capable of working on XB1 and PC, a charging dock and a nice little case to keep it all together, the cost isn’t awful. But if you want all of those things for less, you can grab an S controller, dock and case for far, far less.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6VfCJGOyjLkAkE_mjiHr7rz8Gyw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-6-0c1d7a2ae4e8443ea5b69f559e52bd12.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller"><a href="#Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller"></a><strong>Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller</strong></h2><p> Since the Elite controller really is in a league of its own, the biggest competitor to it is the first generation, which can still be purchased from a number of retailers. We’re going to quickly compare the two to see which might be best for you.</p><p> So we’ve covered a lot of the differences between the two series throughout this article, and while the second iteration is much improved over the first, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-elite-controller-review-4770957" >original Elite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is still a perfectly capable controller with most of the same features. Now that the new one is out, the older model has also dropped a bit in price—making it more appealing. The price of the Series 1 can vary wildly from as little as $100 all the way up to the original tag of $150 depending on where you look, but saving up to $80 for a controller with mostly the same features is an excellent way to get into the Elite series for less.</p><p> Cost aside, there are a few key things you’ll lose if you go with the first model. Perhaps the most noteworthy advantage the Series 2 has is Bluetooth connectivity. This key feature means you no longer need the obtrusive USB wireless adapter to use it with a PC, and it’ll also work with more devices. The other major advantage is the durability improvements on the second iteration, which should make it last even longer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A truly awesome controller with a steep price point.</strong></p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC. However, the steep price point might be a hard pill to swallow for users who don’t like to splurge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037334/7443" target="_top" id="2037334">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037334" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037334/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>MPN  400063527030</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Weight  2.89 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.6 x 3.6 x 7.6 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Type  Elite</li><li>Wired&#x2F;Wireless  Wireless</li><li>Removable Cable  Yes</li><li>Battery life  ~40 hours</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;outputs  USB Type-C, 3.5mm jack, Xbox data port</li><li>Warranty  90-day warranty</li><li>Compatibility  All Xbox One Consoles, Windows 10 PCs, Bluetooth devices</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-affordable-obs-adjustments-and-tweaks-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Affordable OBS Adjustments and Tweaks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/balancing-features-and-price-why-the-google-pixel-4a-is-a-smart-choice-for-most-buyers/"><u>Balancing Features & Price: Why the Google Pixel 4a Is a Smart Choice for Most Buyers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-of-the-moto-g-stylus-excellent-performance-and-acceptable-battery-duration-including-a-built-in-stylus/"><u>Comprehensive Review of the Moto G Stylus - Excellent Performance & Acceptable Battery Duration Including a Built-In Stylus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/get-the-newly-released-magicard-rio-professional-driver-update-supports-windows-os-10-81-and-7/"><u>Get the Newly Released Magicard Rio Professional Driver Update - Supports Windows OS: 10, 8.1 & 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/hardness-must-be-balanced-with-biocompatibility-to-prevent-damage-to-opposing-teeth-and-tissues/"><u>Hardness Must Be Balanced with Biocompatibility to Prevent Damage to Opposing Teeth and Tissues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-the-activation-lock-on-your-ipad-and-iphone-13-pro-max-without-apple-account-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Remove the Activation Lock On your iPad and iPhone 13 Pro Max without Apple Account</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-the-tp-link-ac1200-range-amplifier-model-re305-easy-to-use/"><u>In-Depth Look at the TP-Link AC1200 Range Amplifier, Model RE305 - Easy to Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/is-it-time-to-upgrade-your-fitness-tracker-the-verdict-on-the-fitbit-charge-3/"><u>Is It Time to Upgrade Your Fitness Tracker?

As much as I love my gaming laptops, both of my models, an Eluktronics and an MSI, both feel like they’re about to catch fire whenever I’m playing a heavy-hitting game like Division or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/destiny-2-4158011" >Destiny 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> A couple gaming sessions later, and I realized I needed a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >laptop cooling pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . After taking a look at various models, I decided to try out the HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad. It boasts five fans and an adjustable rollout switch to customize my cooling experience. And it offers anti-slip baffles so my curious cat can’t knock it off my laptop. After over a year of use, I still use this almost every day for my gaming needs. Read on for our final verdict, as well as thoughts on its specs.</p><h2 id="Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad"><a href="#Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad" class="headerlink" title="Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad"></a>Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad</h2><p> HAVIT offers this laptop cooling pad in two different colors: red and blue. I personally felt that the red would be too bright and opted for the blue; when I pulled it out of the box, I was surprised at how heavy its 1.8 pounds felt in my hand.</p><p> On top of the pad itself, it comes with a braided USB cord for protection. It could plug into one of two ports, of which I used the spare to add USB charging for USB compatible items like my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-kindle-2019-review-4688850" >Amazon Kindle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jabra-talk-45-review-5070286" >Java Bluetooth headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J6RTKS-ZdzNqPyF_Tm9lloOF1iM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_04-5a7071fefb884ba19eb68638fdbf1b2b.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977028">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977028.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977028">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977028.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977028%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977028/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust. If you’re looking for a simple design, this is not your cooling pad. That being said, the metal mesh pad for air circulation can accommodate laptops ranging from 14 to 17 inches thanks to its 15.87 x 11.81 x 1.34 inches (LWH) in dimension.</p><h2 id="Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away"><a href="#Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away" class="headerlink" title="Fans: Wasn’t blown away"></a>Fans: Wasn’t blown away</h2><p> I set up the cooling pad and flipped on the roller switch. HAVIT promises five quiet fans—one 110-millimeter fan, and four other strategically placed 85-millimeter fans. HAVIT holds true to its promise: This cooling pad emits a fairly faint sound I can’t hear through my Samsung Buds headphones, even with their noise cancelling features. The fans are so quiet that if I was gaming, I wasn’t able to hear them.</p><p> Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees.</p><p> Better yet, I could adjust the fans to customize how much air I wanted to circulate due to the roller switch HAVIT put as the on&#x2F;off switch. If I wasn’t sure about how much power I was putting into the fans, I could simply lift my laptop up from the pad; as I turned up the power, the blue LED lights in the cooling pad grew brighter.</p><p> Before getting this cooling pad, my Eluktronics laptop sounded like an airplane was taking off and landing at my desk space. I wish I could say that this changed after implementing the pad into my gaming rig, or even with my MSI laptop. Unfortunately, my laptops’ fans still sound like I’m on the tarmac instead of being at home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/l2nDOOm1dGSmniJBqJPn708DnK8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_03-71babed64c14425184604e4825680aac.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> That’s not to say that this laptop cooling pad doesn’t help cool it down. Since my Eluktronics is getting some much-needed TLC in the shop, I tested the MSI’s internal temps while running<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tropico-6-review-5077604" >Tropico Six <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on my laptop. Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees. It’s not much, but it’s enough to make a difference.</p><h2 id="Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing"><a href="#Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing" class="headerlink" title="Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing"></a>Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing</h2><p> If you feel the laptop needs more circulation, the good news is that HAVIT also anticipated these needs, too. Anti-slip baffles offer a sturdy position on any desk, even if you push up the height to a more angled position.</p><p> There is a sturdy flap should you prefer the angled laptop pad, or if you prefer, a sturdier laptop placement while flat. I tested out the height adjustment for a little while, but ultimately decided against using them for personal preference instead of durability reasons.</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hXjExslBR5KBA1RSMPFlkkvF1uQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_02-f065f40118184391b6f1ba1bffa763bd.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> And, if you’re on-the-go and travelling, the HAVIT 5 also packs quite nicely into a suitcase. Be sure to play it safe like I did and pack it around clothes. But if you need to go across country and want to take your gaming laptop with you, this is a good one that will hold up well in luggage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Ouch"><a href="#Price-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Price: Ouch"></a>Price: Ouch</h2><p> I picked up my HAVIT 5 while it was on sale for around $30 back in 2019, but the usual price is around $50. That seems a little steep, especially for fans that don’t necessarily pack the punch for gaming that most laptops require. If you keep an eye on Amazon, you can usually get this one for around $30, as it seems to go on sale fairly often.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lItC7F6Ja8RbBfTaNXh5l9ufFqY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_05-07577b69f7d04de5a7904e798681ba02-6b3615a38d584594b89077eaf51228b2.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> It makes sense to compare the Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad to the HAVIT. Both have five cooling fans, both fit laptops up to 17 inches, and both offer anti-slip baffles to ensure your laptop is safe if you want to adjust the height for more air circulation or wrist angle preferences. The key differences are design and adjustability.</p><p> While the HAVIT is clearly a gaming laptop cooling pad, the Kootak features smooth edges and has a more universal aesthetic to its design. The Kootak is also cheaper, at around $37. If you prefer a true gaming cooling pad, go with the HAVIT. If you don’t care about aesthetics and prefer to be cost conscious, the Kootak will be better suited to your needs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Good, but could be great.</strong></p><p> It’s not the best out there, but so long as it cools the internal laptop core temperatures by about 20 degrees, it’s a worthy investment. Props go to HAVIT for giving it a roller switch for ultimate adjustability and an LED light that will show how high the fans are blowing. The fans could be stronger, but quieter fans over more power is preferable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/urban-armor-gear-macbook-pro-case-review-4689954" >Urban Armor Gear MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958378/18409" target="_top" id="1958378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1958378/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  5 Fan Laptop Cooler</li><li>Product Brand  HAVIT</li><li>MPN  HV-F2068</li><li>Price  $50.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2017</li><li>Weight  1.8 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15.87 x 11.81 x 1.34 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Voltage  5V</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li><li>Connectivity Options  USB port (one cord included)</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-combined-sound-and-sight-workstation/"><u>[Updated] Combined Sound & Sight Workstation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/apple-tv-4k-2021-review/"><u>Apple TV 4K 2021 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/commencing-your-google-meet-experience/"><u>Commencing Your Google Meet Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-garmin-forerunner-265-watch-a-full-review/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis: Garmin Forerunner 265 Watch -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Shopping for an inexpensive but high-quality 4K TV under $1,000 that won’t take up too much space? The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) ticks all those boxes. Despite its low price, this Roku TV is rich with features that rival more expensive options.</p><p> We tested the TCL 50S425 and were impressed by the ease of setup, picture quality, and user-friendliness of this<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8IJD6mxL-mHDn0MMWWRd5yZERlc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_04-bbd6d026c9ec48df9f12c934b7def674.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward"><a href="#Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lightweight and straightforward"></a><strong>Design: Lightweight and straightforward</strong></h2><p> Smart TVs range in size, typically starting from 32 inches and reaching all the way up to 85 inches and beyond. If you can’t accommodate or don’t want a really large television, the TCL 50-inch Roku TV offers a decent middle ground that will appeal to shoppers who want an apartment or dorm-friendly TV without sacrificing quality.</p><p> In appearance, the TCL 50S425 doesn’t reinvent the wheel. It’s black, rectangular, and slim. It comes with the option of wall-mounting or setting it up on a media console or other surface with the enclosed stand. With the legs attached, the set measures 44 inches wide, 28 inches tall, and 8 inches deep and weighs only 23.6 pounds. While the screen is categorized in the 50-inch class the size of the display is 49.5 inches on a diagonal. This lack of bulky bezels surrounding the screen contributes to the slim profile of this TV.</p><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV.</p><p> The Roku remote complements the streamlined design of the screen. In the style of other Roku remotes, it’s a compact and almost weightless wand-like infrared device with a simple and straightforward layout. We found it easy to hold in one hand and easily access all 20 buttons without having to make any grip adjustments. There are also a handful of shortcut buttons for quick access to Netflix, Hulu, the Roku Channel, and ESPN. As long as you point it directly toward the TV, you shouldn’t have any problems with remote performance, but we did notice an occasional lag here or there when the remote seemed to hang and then perform multiple actions in quick succession.</p><p> There are some unfortunate design quirks. The remote’s directional buttons are quite loud. They don’t require a hard press to activate, but they make an audible clicking sound. This is slightly jarring since the other buttons are nearly silent when pressed. Another drawback is the LED status indicator located in the bottom center of the display. By default this light is always on. You can turn this indicator off, but it will continue to blink and flash during other operations, which we sometimes found distracting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cT13RJhaMjC05v7eMym3vtM8M0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_05-70fc23cf6c2b4a13ac9d46f9372010ef.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Up and running in minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Up and running in minutes</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 50-inch TCL Roku TV is a breeze. We opted to forego mounting the television, but the user manual indicates that this model is compatible with a VESA 200 x 200 wall mount with M6 x 12mm screws.</p><p> As directed, we placed the monitor face down on a plush surface and attached the two stand legs using the four MS x 25mm screws. After situating the television on a shelf, we plugged the unit into a wall outlet using the enclosed AC power cord. Once the TV was plugged in, it powered on immediately and displayed the guided setup process. These steps were very straightforward and included first setting a language preference, a network connection, and activating the device. The other critical step with setup involves either signing up for or logging into an existing Roku account.</p><p> Since we already had a Roku account, all of our previously selected channels and apps downloaded to the TV, which just took a few minutes, and then we were free to begin exploring. The amount of additional setup is pretty minimal. By default, you’ll see an HDR notification when you’re viewing HDR-enabled content, but you can turn this off from the settings panel if you like.</p><p> Additionally, if you plan to use a set-top cable box or antenna, the user manual offers straightforward instructions for doing so. You also have the option of enabling the Smart TV experience when you use antenna TV mode. This setting uses automatic content recognition (ACR) to make viewing recommendations based on what you view through your antenna or connected HDMI devices.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking</strong></h2><p> One of the biggest draws of a 4K TV is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which offers four times the resolution quality of a standard high definition TV. This pixel resolution is also commonly referred to as Ultra HD (UHD). This Roku TV also comes with HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which is commonly bundled with 4K resolution in the newest smart TVs.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR improves image quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by intensifying the contrast between white and black areas on the screen while achieving a solid balance, so nothing looks too dark or too bright. It also broadens the palette of available colors, especially in combination with Wide Color Gamut (WCG).</p><p> One thing we noticed right out of the gate is how vivid 4K content looks. To test the 4K image quality, we started by exploring the 4K Spotlight content. This section includes links to 4K movies, TV, and videos. We found a couple of nature-themed 4K videos on YouTube and were really impressed with what we saw. A video touring Zion National Park looked almost 3D and we practically felt like we were there. The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> Apart from 4K nature videos, we also browsed 4K movies and TV shows through the Amazon Prime app. We found the same appealing mix of crisp picture quality, vibrant colors, and contrast. Even standard high definition shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, and Prime looked quite good on screen. Though it’s hard to say if there’s a considerable difference, TCL is eager to boast about the power of their 4K Creative Pro upscaling feature which renders regular HD content into 4K-like quality. The bottom line is that HD content looks great across the board, upscaled or not.</p><p> The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> With the handy multi-purpose asterisk button you can alter a number of display settings, and you can access this options menu in the middle of viewing content. Adjusting picture settings doesn’t require exiting an app or pausing whatever you’re watching, which lets you make adjustments and immediately see the result. You can add more vibrancy and contrast to whatever you’re watching, or enable modes like Movie when you’re viewing a film in the evening or with the lights dimmed.</p><p> You can control everything from backlighting to brightness, contrast, and dynamic contrast. This last setting is particularly relevant to HDR content because it helps balance the light and dark settings on your screen so that there’s no excess in either direction. The online user manual does a fine job of explaining some of the advanced picture settings, and even just toggling through the menu on the TV brings up a description of what you’re changing.</p><p> Regular picture mode and the predefined 4K HDR picture settings were on point, which made viewing right out of the box extremely easy and pleasant. We were also pleased by the picture quality from all angles. Getting too close or too far out to the right or left did reveal some shadows and distortion, but only at fairly extreme angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Lv4B9e6LaJSHW7NSl-Braa2vnmc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_03-b8155781e440420aa0c6c2bf19f9fe6a.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/c/5597632/1622438/14044" target="_top" id="1622438">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14044-1622438" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/i/5597632/1622438/14044"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111964/7443" target="_top" id="2111964">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111964" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111964/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding</strong></h2><p> While the TCL Roku TV offers impressive picture quality, the sound is less noteworthy. The two built-in 8-watt speakers offer decent volume levels, but there’s no advanced audio settings menu in this model. You do have control over aspects like sound mode and volume mode. The default sound mode is “normal,” which is appropriate for everyday viewing. But you can also select options for higher treble, more bass, movie, or music mode. As for volume modes, you can either turn on leveling, to balance the contrast between lows and highs in audio, or enable night mode, which sets a threshold for how high the volume can go.</p><p> We did notice some issues with what sounded like crackling and extreme lows and highs in dialog and music, though we were able to smooth these issues out by tweaking a few settings.</p><p> In our testing experience in a small room, the internal speakers were more than adequate without the need for additional speakers. If you do want another layer of dimension to your audio, you might consider opting for the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-speakers-and-home-theater-1846770" >wireless speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> designed specifically for Roku TV sets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oA3AbTZysdVWZbOWuuVGOa56_8c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_02-04183ae8dcd44b778b4da0e7706d5df2.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive and streamlined"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive and streamlined</strong></h2><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV and a big part of the equation is the operating system. The TCL 50S425 operates on Roku OS 9.1, and it’s extremely user-friendly. Updates are automatic so there’s no manual effort required on your part, and the interface is laid out in a clear and uncomplicated manner.</p><p> The Home screen features all of your apps, which you can arrange and delete with the click of the asterisk button. All the other menus are easy to identify as well. There’s a search page, a streaming channels section, and the settings menu. This clean and straightforward layout may not be the most sophisticated, but it’s easy to use and simplicity is the beauty of this system.</p><p> While the remote doesn’t come with a built-in speaker, the free Roku app does offer a voice-assistant feature. It’s best when completing a general search for a show or actor or for launching a particular app. If you have a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa enabled device, this Roku TV will support them, and they offer a generally better experience than using the Roku app voice remote function.</p><h2 id="Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great bargain on a budget"></a><strong>Price: A great bargain on a budget</strong></h2><p> If you don’t want to spend a fortune on a 4K TV, but you want to get as much value as possible, the TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a compelling option. It retails for $350, which situates it in the growing and competitive class of 4K TVs under $500. In the TCL 4-Series alone you have several other models to consider that all share the same specifications except for size. The larger 55-inch TCL Roku TV retails for just $30 more than the 50-inch version and features a larger screen size of 54.6 inches. It may not seem considerable, but if you’re limited with space, the extra width and height (five and two inches, respectively) can actually feel like a pretty massive difference. And if you opt for a smaller display and a lower price tag, the 43-inch TCL Roku TV retails for about $280, but you’re sacrificing 7 inches of display.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983446">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983446">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983446%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983446/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition"><a href="#TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition" class="headerlink" title="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"></a><strong>TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</strong></h2><p> The TCL 50-inch Roku TV is not without external competitors either. The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition retails for about $100 more and runs on the Fire OS, which stands toe-to-toe with the Roku platform with access to over 500,000 shows and movies. The Toshiba Fire TV comes with an Alexa-enabled remote, an edge for shoppers who want the ease of a voice assistant built right into the remote. But the Roku TV supports both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as voice control through the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> While the Toshiba TV is in the 55-inch class, the screen size is actually the same as the Roku TV. The former, however is visibly taller, wider, and bulkier. The Toshiba Fire TV does havea slight advantage when it comes to audio quality. The sound can get quite loud and full-bodied, thanks to two 10-watt speakers and DTS Studio Sound&#x2F;DTS TruSurround. On the other hand, the picture quality may not be as impressive as the Roku TV, which really doesn’t require a lot of tweaking to enjoy. And if you’re a fan of the simple Roku interface, you may find the Fire OS dashboard to be a bit cluttered.</p><p> Browse our other recommendations on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >best smart TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and best TVs under $500.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/toshiba-55lf711u20-55-inch-fire-tv-edition-review-4772221" >Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A budget-friendly 4K TV that offers impressive picture and overall value.</strong></p><p> The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a smart 4K TV that possesses many merits: an appealing price point, excellent 4K HDR picture quality, a size profile that won’t overwhelm small rooms or apartments, and an easy-to-use interface that requires little fuss.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is a 43-inch 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) television that’s built on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-4152887" >Amazon’s Fire TV platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so it features<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-alexa-with-your-tv-4161152" >Alexa voice controls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the familiar Fire TV interface. In addition to 4K resolution, it also features<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >HDR support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a decent number of HDMI ports, and built-in stereo speakers.</p><p> Insignia is Best Buy’s in-house budget brand, which calls for tempered expectations, but we were pleasantly surprised on a lot of fronts when we sat down to watch our test unit. We tested things like viewing angles, color reproduction, sound quality, and more to see if this budget Fire TV is really worth a sport in your living room.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MXH7eY7oDLeZbWXcastu1A7OhpQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-5-2ec275929e8543f0ab9c4ada6276d84c.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134242/18498" target="_top" id="2134242">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134242" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134242/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Design-Thick-body-thick-bezel-but-light-enough-for-one-person-to-handle"><a href="#Design-Thick-body-thick-bezel-but-light-enough-for-one-person-to-handle" class="headerlink" title="Design: Thick body, thick bezel, but light enough for one person to handle"></a><strong>Design: Thick body, thick bezel, but light enough for one person to handle</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is thick and boxy, with a fairly wide bezel, and large feet that mount perpendicularly instead of angling like a lot of other inexpensive sets. It isn’t anything special to look at, but that’s to be expected from a budget line like Insignia. The good thing is that it’s fairly light, at less than 20 pounds, and the large feet make it quite steady.</p><p> Most of the ports are found on the left side of the set, as you face it, with a few of them oriented downward instead.</p><p> The power button is situated in a semi-translucent plastic bulge near one of the feet, making it easy to locate, and you can use the same button to switch inputs. There are no other physical buttons on this set, so don’t lose the remote.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones.</p><p> This television uses a standard detachable C7 power cord instead of a hard-wired power cable, and it features a standard 200 x 200 millimeter<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tv-wall-mounts-3276137" >VESA mount <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to ditch the clunky feet and hang it on a wall.</p><p> While this set does have Alexa built right in, it works like a Fire TV Stick and not like a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-4172274" >Fire TV Cube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-amazon-echo-4147189" >Echo device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . What that means is it lacks far-field microphones, so you have to give commands via the remote. The remote itself is the same basic design that’s included with other Fire TV devices, but it includes volume buttons, a live TV button, and preset shortcuts for a few streaming services.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8ovvGrqb8Me9IvWHrQc7UW02kw8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-4-acb78e6d55e4488ca394495d5c74c754.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password</strong></h2><p> Despite being a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-43-inch-tvs-4588664" >43-inch class television <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance. It’s even packed in a bag that has convenient handles, making it easy to lift up and out of the box and set carefully on a table for assembly.</p><p> This television comes more or less ready to go, but the feet have to be attached if you aren’t going to wall mount it. The feet are clearly marked as to which side needs to point toward the front of the television, and each one attaches with two Phillips screws. If you have a Phillips screwdriver at hand, you can have everything tightened up and the television standing up within a couple minutes.</p><p> Despite being a 43-inch class television, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance.</p><p> Once the feet are on, or the television has been hung on a wall mount, it’s time to turn it on. This presents you with the Fire TV interface, so you should be ready to pick your favorite apps, connect to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430" >Wi-Fi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or wired network, and then log into your Amazon account if you want to get the most out of your new television. There’s also a basic mode if you don’t have an Amazon account or just don’t want to log in.</p><p> The final part of the setup process involves waiting for your apps to download, and then allowing the Fire TV to download and install a firmware update. None of this is too terribly time consuming, but plan on setting aside at least 10 to 15 minutes before your TV is fully ready to watch.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is a 4K UHD television with HDR support, and the picture quality is a massive improvement over lower resolution (1080p, 720p) televisions, especially if you have hardware or media that’s capable of taking advantage of the increased resolution. Game consoles like the 4K-capable Xbox One X and PS4 Pro look great, as do UHD Blu-rays.</p><p> We also loaded up Amazon Prime Video, which includes a bunch of 4K content if you don’t have any UHD devices. Watching an episode of The Tick, Peter Serafinowicz’s bright blue suit popped against the comparatively drab cityscape, and the action was clear and crisp as he bounded from building to building.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles.</p><p> Colors look great across all kinds of different content, but the contrast isn’t as good. Dark scenes seem a bit muddy, with areas that should be perfect black being lighter than they really should be.</p><p> While this set does have UHD support, it’s limited to HDR10 and doesn’t support local dimming. That means the HDR isn’t as effective as you’ll see in more expensive televisions, but it’s still great for a budget TV like this.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles. When backed up to a more appropriate distance, we didn’t have any problem viewing this television from any seat in the house.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135412/19272" target="_top" id="2135412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135412/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set</strong></h2><p> Built-in television speakers usually aren’t very good, which is why soundbars are popular. That’s especially true of budget television sets, but the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 actually has decent audio quality. You’ll probably want to invest in a soundbar if you don’t already have one, but the sound quality is good enough that you can get by with the built-in speakers if you need to.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones. We also loaded up Amazon Music, turned the volume up, and found that the speakers were loud enough to fill the room without any noticeable distortion. The speakers are definitely lacking in bass, but it’s still surprisingly good for a budget television.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OfRGDj7hZY6nrkoT_HqDEM1S9Ts=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-2-8b38ffeb5ce44c0d9a6c7aa7f6dce4cd.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043855/7443" target="_top" id="2043855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs"><a href="#Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs" class="headerlink" title="Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs"></a><strong>Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs</strong></h2><p> The ports are split, with some on the left side of the television as you face it, and others exiting toward the bottom.</p><p> On the left side, you’ll find a headphone jack, USB port, and two HDMI ports. The first HDMI port is also ARC capable, which means you can use it to feed audio signals to a compatible soundbar without requiring a separate audio cable.</p><p> On the bottom, you’ll find an ethernet port, digital optical output, RCA jacks for analog video and audio inputs, a coaxial connector for your antenna or cable box, and a third HDMI port.</p><p> All of the ports are well clear of the VESA mount, so you shouldn’t lose access to them if you opt to mount the set on a wall. The exception is that if you use a flush mount, you’ll have trouble reaching the down-facing bank of ports due to the way that the chassis of the television bulges out at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V97gOTfZ6Zys4aZv9gzGupbwRi8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-3-b8a8cb21803f40ada92bf08de6ee6fc0.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive"><a href="#Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive" class="headerlink" title="Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive"></a><strong>Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the Fire TV edition of this hardware. It also comes in a slightly different configuration that’s built on the Roku platform instead, but this one has Fire TV baked in with no option to switch.</p><p> As a Fire TV, this television is excellent. It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks. If you primarily use your television for streaming through apps like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube, then you won’t have any problems with this television.</p><p> It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks.</p><p> We also tested out the Alexa voice command implementation and found that it works very well. Even with two other Alexa devices in earshot, including a Fire TV Cube, the Insignia’s voice remote picked up and executed our commands flawlessly.</p><p> If you watch a lot of broadcast television or have a cable box, the Fire TV interface can be a bit more frustrating. The main issue is that the Fire TV remote just isn’t built with regular television use in mind, as it lacks a numeric keypad.</p><p> You can ask Alexa to tune to specific channels, and the Fire TV interface has a section for over the air television channels, but the implementation is a little clumsy in its current incarnation.</p><h2 id="Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs"><a href="#Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs" class="headerlink" title="Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs"></a><strong>Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 has an MSRP of $299.99, but it’s typically available for around $249.99. Priced at around $249.99, it’s right in the general neighborhood of other 43-inch class smart televisions, including other Fire TVs, sets built around Roku, and others with proprietary systems. There are a lot of decent options in the general $200 to $250 range, but this one is the best of the bunch if you’re firmly entrenched in Amazon’s ecosystem.</p><h2 id="Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models"><a href="#Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models"></a><strong>Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models</strong></h2><p> Compared to previous 43-inch class televisions built on the Fire TV platform, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the clear winner. For example, the Toshiba 43LF421U19 is a 43-inch class set that’s also built on the Fire TV platform, and sells for about $299.99, but it’s worse than the Insignia in almost every category. It isn’t 4K or HDR-capable, the viewing angles are worse, colors aren’t as good, and the built-in Fire TV is sluggish compared to the Insignia unit that we tested.</p><p> Toshiba’s 43LF621U19 Fire TV Edition is a 4K UHD television that comes closer to matching the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19, with an MSRP of $329.99, a similar set of ports, and a basic mode that doesn’t require an Amazon account. It also has worse contrast and color range, so the Insignia is still our recommendation of the two.</p><p> If you aren’t specifically focused on Fire TV, the TCL 43S517 is a decent alternative to this set. It’s a 43-inch class smart TV that’s built on the Roku platform instead of Fire TV, and it works a bit better is a regular television, with cable and over the air broadcasts, than the Insignia. It also has ever so slightly better color reproduction. It does have a higher MSRP of $499, but it’s typically available for around $240 to $260.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>This is the budget Fire TV to own if you can’t step up to a larger model.</strong></p><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 isn’t perfect, but it’s probably as close as you’ll get at this price point. This is definitely the UHD TV to own in the 43-inch class if you’re deep in the Amazon ecosystem and really want to go with Fire TV as your smart TV platform. It has great color reproduction, excellent viewing angles, and even decent sound from the onboard stereo speakers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111995/7443" target="_top" id="2111995">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111995" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111995/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  NS-43DF710NA19 43” 4K Fire TV</li><li>Product Brand  Insignia</li><li>UPC  600603233920</li><li>Price  $300.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2018</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.9 x 38.2 x 24.3 in.</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li><li>Compatibility  Alexa, Fire TV</li><li>Platform  Fire TV</li><li>Screen Size  42.5 inches</li><li>Screen Resolution  2160p (4K)</li><li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)  Yes</li><li>Refresh Rate  60Hz</li><li>Maximum Contrast Ratio  4000:1</li><li>Ports  3x HDMI, USB, Digital Optical Audio Output, RCA Audio Output, Composite Video Input, RF Antenna Input, Headphone Jack, Ethernet</li><li>Speakers  Stereo 8-watt speakers</li><li>Connectivity Options  Wi-Fi, Ethernet</li><li>Mount Included  No</li><li>Stand Included  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-create-a-google-meet-account/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved How to Create a Google Meet Account</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-top-20-free-public-domain-pubg-screenshot-slideshows/"><u>[New] Top 20 Free Public Domain PUBG Screenshot Slideshows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tips-and-tricks-for-perfect-tweets-with-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Tips and Tricks for Perfect Tweets with Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/flight-simulation-at-its-best-the-x-plane-11-analysis-showcases-impressive-graphics-upgrades/"><u>Flight Simulation at Its Best: The X-Plane 11 Analysis Showcases Impressive Graphics Upgrades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/halo-bolt-jump-starter-and-portable-charger-expert-review-and-analysis/"><u>Halo Bolt Jump Starter and Portable Charger - Expert Review & Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-apple-iphone-xs-max-unavailable-issue-with-ease-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Fix Apple iPhone XS Max Unavailable Issue With Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-xiaomi-14-by-phone-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track Xiaomi 14 by Phone Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/microsofts-new-surface-pro-7-evaluation-revealed-steady-performance-boost-and-slight-improvements/"><u>Microsoft's New Surface Pro 7 Evaluation Revealed: Steady Performance Boost and Slight Improvements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/1726030140487-mpeg-2024/"><u>MPEG-Ⅴ再生エラーを修正するための最新トリック（2024年版）</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/ps5-showdown-how-does-the-ps5-slim-stack-up-against-its-original-version/"><u>PS5 Showdown: How Does the PS5 Slim Stack Up Against Its Original Version?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/secure-your-dream-samsung-device-at-unbeatable-prices-this-prime-day/"><u>Secure Your Dream Samsung Device at Unbeatable Prices This Prime Day</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/smartphone-showdown-which-is-better-iphones-or-samsungs-for-your-next-purchase/"><u>Smartphone Showdown: Which Is Better?

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135350/19272" target="_top" id="2135350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135350/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner.

Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes.

The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.
