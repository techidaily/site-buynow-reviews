These tools are a must-have for anyone looking to purchase a second-hand vehicle, allowing you to quickly reveal any glaring inadequacies the previous owner may have failed to mention.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-Overall"><a href="#Best-Overall" class="headerlink" title="Best Overall"></a>Best Overall</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I" >Ancel Classic OBD Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/89GEP5wvXrJ2pm04eqq2t7sjeNs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ancel-classic-enhanced-universal-obd-ii-scanner-49eabf2abdfb48d18a3374996f6cc802.jpg" >ANCEL Classic Enhanced Universal OBD II Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I" >$21 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Easy-to-use keypad</li><li>Compact design</li><li>No battery required</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Low reader accuracy</li><li>Some compatibility issues</li></ul><p> The Ancel Classic OBD Scanner is easy to use, even for those uncomfortable working on cars. It works on most cars made in the U.S. after 1996 or in the EU or Asia after 2000 and supports multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, Russian, and German. The large LCD has a white backlight to make it easy to read even in dim lighting.</p><p> If it turns out that your code isn’t serious, this device can turn off that annoying check engine light. The scanner comes with a 2.5-foot long, well-insulated cable that connects with your car’s OBDII data link connector; no other battery or charger is required as it powers up through that link. A three-year warranty means you can rest easy choosing this scanner.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> No |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> Yes |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.02”x6.34”x1.38” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 9.6 Oz</p><h2 id="Splurge"><a href="#Splurge" class="headerlink" title="Splurge"></a>Splurge</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >BlueDriver Professional OBDII Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >$100 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/415766460" >$120 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works through a user-friendly app</li><li>Durable</li><li>Always stays plugged in</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Bluetooth connection can be a bit spotty</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><p> The BlueDriver OBDII Scanner isn’t the cheapest option out there, but seeing as it’s aimed at those who want more professional readings than you can get from all-in-one units, that’s to be expected. This tiny sensor, once installed, transmits codes, errors, and information via Bluetooth to the BlueDriver app. This app is the centerpiece of the whole unit, as it’s one of the most beautifully designed and full-featured pieces of software we’ve seen. You can call up codes, search them, and even set the app into HUD mode to treat it as an onboard meter.</p><p> What’s extra interesting about this is the 24&#x2F;7 support, meaning you can contact an actual human if you need more information on a particular reading. You can even have the app generate on-demand repair reports compiled and verified by certified technicians. These repair reports are pulled from a database of over 6.6 million vehicle-specific diagnostics, so chances are, you can pull one up for your specific vehicle.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Yes |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> No |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.2”x1.9”x1” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 2.08 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123735/7443" target="_top" id="2123735">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123735" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123735/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Car Code Reader"></a>What to Look For in a Car Code Reader</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886048/19272" target="_top" id="1886048">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886048" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886048/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Ease of Use"></a>Ease of Use</h3><p> If you haven’t had a car code reader before, purchase a simple one.

OBD2 is a universal interface in most cars introduced in the 1980s. While it won’t work on every old car out there, you should be covered as long as it is somewhat new. Almost all newer cars will support it.</li><li>Are car code readers worth it?<br> Car code readers are relatively inexpensive, making them a worthwhile investment if you want to pinpoint an issue with your vehicle without taking it to an expensive mechanic. A car code reader lets you read and clear codes, view basic parameter IDs, and check and reset readiness monitors. This gives you an excellent way to tell if the problem is something you can fix quickly before shelling out to a car shop, potentially saving you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-boost-engagement-with-smart-video-cropping-and-exporting/"><u>[New] Boost Engagement with Smart Video Cropping & Exporting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-maximize-impact-with-custom-icons-and-graphics-on-your-instagram-posts/"><u>[New] In 2024, Maximize Impact with Custom Icons and Graphics on Your Instagram Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-step-by-step-subtitle-insertion-for-vimeo-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Step-by-Step Subtitle Insertion for Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-sculpt-your-vision-editing-videos-using-story-remix-and-windows-photos/"><u>[New] Sculpt Your Vision Editing Videos Using Story Remix and Windows Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-elevating-emotion-the-art-of-tiktok-effects/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Emotion The Art of TikTok Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/11-proven-solutions-to-fix-google-play-store-not-working-issue-on-honor-play-8t-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>11 Proven Solutions to Fix Google Play Store Not Working Issue on Honor Play 8T | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/avantree-headphones-unseen-innovations-revealed/"><u>Avantree Headphones: Unseen Innovations Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/detailed-analysis-of-lamicalls-innovative-tablet-stand-solution/"><u>Detailed Analysis of Lamicall's Innovative Tablet Stand Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-how-bouncies-connected-drive-device-offers-simple-navigation-for-less/"><u>Discover How Bouncie's Connected Drive Device Offers Simple Navigation for Less</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-motorola-edge-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Motorola Edge 2023? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-i-bypass-a-forgotten-phone-password-of-xiaomi-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Can I Bypass a Forgotten Phone Password Of Xiaomi?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/iphone-13-analysis-in-depth-performance-insights/"><u>IPhone 13 Analysis: In-Depth Performance Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/major-league-baseball-the-show-19-analysis-stunning-visuals-meet-unexpected-rpg-features/"><u>Major League Baseball: The Show 19 Analysis - Stunning Visuals Meet Unexpected RPG Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/sx420-unleashed-optical-magic-for-the-budget-photographer/"><u>SX420 Unleashed: Optical Magic for the Budget Photographer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-10-fingerprint-lock-apps-to-lock-your-itel-p55-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 10 Fingerprint Lock Apps to Lock Your Itel P55 Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/why-the-motorola-one-hyper-is-a-must-have-in-the-mid-range-phone-market/"><u>Why the Motorola One Hyper Is a Must-Have in the Mid-Range Phone Market</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Apple is no stranger to creating minimal devices, but the 21.5-inch 4K iMac takes things to a whole new level with a screen that pops and a design that looks stylish no matter the setting. As beautiful as it is on the outside, under the hood you also have a solid set of components with a 3.4GHz 7th generation quad-core Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 1TB Fusion Drive. Apple has managed to pack quite a bit of power inside the slender frame. We put it to the test to see how it fares for multimedia and productivity uses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TCcSm-nkER9HhHM8YIPMWbaezRA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-4-fa6cf253bfd44ab991c366691b68bdf5.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements"><a href="#Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements" class="headerlink" title="Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements"></a><strong>Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements</strong></h2><p> It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >beautiful machine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from top to bottom. Before even turning it on, the design of the computer a striking, aluminum-clad body that’s still subtle enough that it will blend in with nearly any office or home environment.</p><p> The tapered design makes the edges appear almost non-existent while its bulkier behind manages to round things out in a proportional manner. At its thinnest point — the edges — the iMac measures in at just 0.2 inches. On its integrated stand, the iMac measures in at 17.7 inches tall, 20.8 inches wide, and 6.9 inches deep. Amazingly, all of that weighs in at just 12.5 pounds, not including the keyboard and mouse.</p><p> Overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package.</p><p> Aside from the Apple logo on the front aluminum chin of the iMac, all of the connections and ports on the iMac are on the rear of the computer. This includes, left to right: a 3.5mm headphone jack, SD card slot, four USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 3.0 ports (USB-C), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and power adapter. There’s also a Kensington lock slot to let you secure the the iMac.</p><p> We would’ve liked to see a thinner bezel around the screen, as the one present on the iMac is about half an inch — much larger than even the most basic PC monitors. It’d be a bit different if Apple were doing more with that real estate, but as it stands, it feels like wasted space</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gM_JxuZjDbSUs7DYtXIwUIqqz0Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-3-d30c5f8414e94cbd9b1ec8aea9b18950.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go"></a><strong>Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go</strong></h2><p> One of Apple’s core tenets is simplicity, and the 4K iMac is no exception to this rule. Inside the box is the computer itself and a box which contains the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. Additional components include the power connection for the computer, a Lightning cable for charging the mouse and keyboard, and a small package of documentation.</p><p> Setting up the iMac is as simple as unwrapping it from its protective cover, setting it on the desk, plugging it in with the included power cord, and pressing the power button. As it boots up, we turned on the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. By the time the iMac was to the setup screen — a process that took approximately 60 seconds — the two were already paired with the computer and ready to be used.</p><p> Going through the setup process took us approximately five minutes, which included setting up our iCloud account and getting the various login settings in place. We opted to set this up as a new computer, but there’s also the ability to set it up from an Apple Time Capsule backup or transfer content from a PC via USB. The amount of time those options take will vary depending on the device you’re transferring the information from as well as the amount of data being transferred.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016170/19272" target="_top" id="2016170">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016170" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016170/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine"><a href="#Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine"></a><strong>Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine</strong></h2><p> With a resolution of 4096 x 2304 pixels, the 4K iMac has more than 9.4 million pixels and features a pixel density of 217 pixels per inch, more than enough to make individual pixels indistinguishable at normal viewing distances.

Unlike a traditional hard drive (HDD), which relies exclusively on spinning platters to write and read information, Apple’s Fusion Drive also adds a small solid state storage (SSD) partition. This is where the operating system and most critical applications are stored, as solid state memory is much faster than traditional HDDs. The result is a drive that offers some of the advantages of SSDs while still offering the more affordable price tag and capacity of HDDs.</p><p> In our tests, boot-up time ranged from 15 seconds to 25 seconds. Considering the hybrid-style Fusion Drive, this lines up with our expectations, falling right between SSD speeds and HDD speeds. The same held true with boot-up times for various applications, ranging from Safari to more resource-intensive applications such as Final Cut Pro.</p><p> Moving onto the CPU and GPU benchmarks, we tested the iMac with both Geekbench and Cinebench to see how well the 3.4GHz quad-core processor and AMD Radeon Pro 560 held up.</p><p> “Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac.”</p><p> In the Geekbench tests, the iMac scored 4,866 on the single core test, 14,151 on the multi-core test, and 56,974 on the OpenCL score. This falls in line with other iMacs of the same specifications and hovers around other computers with similar specifications. In Cinebench, the iMac achieved 93.86 frames per second in the OpenGL test and a score of 584 cb in the CPU test.</p><p> All-in-all, the iMac seems to punch right at or above its specifications when compared to similar hardware. It’s not going to be pumping out 8K footage, but for basic 4K video editing and image post-processing, the graphics card is more than enough. As for productivity, there’s not much you can throw at the iMac that it can’t handle. The only thing we noticed slowing down the computer was the 8GB of RAM when we had over a dozen applications open, but that can be fixed by upgrading to the 16GB or 32GB model (although it’s not a cheap upgrade).</p><h2 id="Network-Fast-and-reliable"><a href="#Network-Fast-and-reliable" class="headerlink" title="Network: Fast and reliable"></a><strong>Network: Fast and reliable</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac features both wired and wireless connectivity for internet access. As previously mentioned, the iMac features a Gigabit Ethernet (RJ-45) port on the rear of the computer for a hardwired internet connection. For Wi-Fi, the iMac uses an 802.11ac network adapter with support for IEEE 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n.</p><p> In our hardwired tests, the iMac maxed out our Gigabit fiber optic internet no problem, with steady download and upload speeds. Wireless connectivity was equally impressive, regardless of whether the iMac was in the same room as the router or a few rooms over. We didn’t notice any drops throughout our tests and both uploading and downloading content was consistent.</p><h2 id="Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks"><a href="#Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks"></a><strong>Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks</strong></h2><p> The only camera on the 4K iMac is the integrated webcam, which sits dead center above the display. We would’ve liked to see a 1080p or even 4K webcam included, but the 720p resolution is good enough for basic video messaging.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rFu0_k9BjbUxQdoEYOcNGU35LJA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-2-a3d2f38b9509480ba41bbb5b33815d1a.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Software-Everything-you-need-and-nothing-more"><a href="#Software-Everything-you-need-and-nothing-more" class="headerlink" title="Software: Everything you need and nothing more"></a><strong>Software: Everything you need and nothing more</strong></h2><p> As with all Apple computers, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac comes with macOS Mojave pre-installed. If you’re used to macOS as a whole, you’ll feel right at home as we did. Compared to past versions of macOS, Mojave improves in a number of areas, including an integrated Dark mode that turns much of the user interface dark grey to spare your eyes. There’s also a feature called “Stacks” that intelligently combines files of the same type on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Improved<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-screenshot-1701742" >screenshot functionality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also makes snapping your screen easier.</p><p> One of the stand-out benefits of macOS is that you’ll never have to worry about paid upgrades. Apple annually announces and subsequently releases a new operating system, free of charge, to install on Apple computers. In-between major releases Apple will also push out incremental updates, at least two of which we installed during our review process. These incremental installs can be done either manually within the System Preferences applications or be set to install themselves automatically when the computer is plugged in and powered on.</p><p> Unlike Windows, macOS doesn’t come with any bloatware either. There’s a number of pre-installed apps developed by Apple, including four new ones borrowed from Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, but most of the pre-installed apps are the standard array of programs you’d expect to see on any modern computer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real"><a href="#Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real" class="headerlink" title="Price: The Apple tax is real"></a><strong>Price: The Apple tax is real</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac we tested with the aforementioned specifications retails for $1,499. Compared to other Windows PCs with similar specifications, the iMac is without pricey for the specs it offers. However, this is par for the course with Apple, so much so that the term “Apple tax” has become a commonly-used phrase. What you’re paying for is the entire package, wrapped up in one of the best-looking frames out there.</p><p> Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely.

If you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem and don’t need to shell out for the more expensive 27-inch 5K iMac, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is priced much more reasonably and still has plenty to offer.</p><h2 id="Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market"><a href="#Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A unique option in a small market"></a><strong>Competition: A unique option in a small market</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac has a few competitors in its specification range, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two: the Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO 700 and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.asus.com/displays-desktops/all-in-one-pcs/zen-aio/" >Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> All three all-in-one desktops feature 4K displays (or at least the option to order them with 4K displays). Aside from that, the specifications also line up similarly, with i7 CPU configurations, dedicated GPU options, SSD variations, and beefy memory choices.</p><p> Of course, the biggest difference between the three desktops is that the 21.5-inch 4K iMac runs macOS while the other two run Windows 10. Using Apple’s included Boot Camp program, it’s possible to run Windows 10 (and other operating systems) on the iMac, but macOS isn’t able to be run on the other devices.</p><p> Other differences include various connections options on the back of the computers and variations in size—most notably the iMac is quite a bit smaller in dimensions across the board. That said, the larger size allows easier access to internals which makes upgrading easier on the Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 700 and Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC.</p><p> Prices vary greatly between the three desktops depending on the configuration you’re looking for, but overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac seems to hold its own in this price range, despite Apple’s notoriety for being a little bit on the pricier side.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Beautiful display in a thin, powerful machine.</strong></p><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package. It’s not going to blow anyone away on benchmarks and it’s not cheap for the internal components you’re getting, but it has a lot to offer for multimedia and productivity. That’s not to mention the sheer convenience of having everything simply work out of the box.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977004">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977004">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977004%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977004/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-studio-2-review-4689102" >Microsoft Surface Studio 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r7-review-4689097" >Alienware Aurora R7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkcentre-m720-tower-review-4776238" >Lenovo ThinkCentre M720 Tower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iMac 21.5-inch 4K</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>UPC  190198085795</li><li>Price  $1,499.00</li><li>Weight  12.5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  17.7 x 20.8 x 6.9 in.</li><li>Platform  Windows 10 Home</li><li>CPU  3.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i5</li><li>GPU  Raden Pro 560</li><li>RAM  8GB</li><li>Storage  1TB Fusion Drive</li><li>Connections  3.5 mm headphone jack, SDXC card slot, Four USB 3 ports (compatible with USB 2), Two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, 10&#x2F;100&#x2F;1000BASE-T Gigabit</li><li>What’s in the box  21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display Magic Keyboard Magic Mouse 2 Power cord Lightning to USB Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-busting-barriers-with-laughs-the-best-facebook-prisoner-wit-quotes/"><u>2024 Approved Busting Barriers with Laughs The Best Facebook Prisoner-Wit Quotes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/capture-oceanic-vistas-with-the-versatile-insta360-one-x2/"><u>Capture Oceanic Vistas with the Versatile Insta360 One X2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-lamicall-tablet-support-reviews-prioritizing-practicality-and-convenience/"><u>Comprehensive Lamicall Tablet Support Reviews: Prioritizing Practicality and Convenience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-the-perfect-travel-companion-for-readers-in-depth-review-of-the-kobo-clara-hd/"><u>Discover the Perfect Travel Companion for Readers: In-Depth Review of the Kobo Clara HD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/exploring-the-benefits-and-drawbacks-a-comprehensive-look-at-the-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-as-the-prime-choice-for-android-users/"><u>Exploring the Benefits and Drawbacks: A Comprehensive Look at the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra as the Prime Choice for Android Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/gratis-online-verwandeln-van-webm-naar-gif-mit-movavi-kort-en-efficient/"><u>Gratis Online Verwandeln Van WebM Naar GIF Mit Movavi -

When you tune in to the Express, you get access to thousands of free and premium shows you may never have discovered on the choice few apps of your smart TV, or on the same reruns that show up on your cable subscription. If you’re afraid of leaving cable, know that many primetime shows are on some streaming platform out there, and for much less money. You can get started with a $30 streaming device and a $10 subscription.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5BliKk_HCRh9uM25VqPW6CH1Aeo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Roku_HeroHoriz-d20f17de8595463eb5e4bdf55a2f3387.jpg"                      alt="Roku Express"                ></p><p> Lifewire&#x2F;Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-Small-and-easy-to-position"><a href="#Design-Small-and-easy-to-position" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small and easy to position"></a><strong>Design: Small and easy to position</strong></h2><p> The Roku Express is a small package consisting of a palm-sized remote and the actual streaming box, which is half that size. It comes along with a power brick and micro USB to power the box, a battery for the remote, a two-foot HDMI cable, and an adhesive strip to stick your box to, say, the bottom of your television.</p><p> The adhesive strip is nice, as it gives ideas as to how to position the box in your living room in a place that’s both practical and aesthetically pleasing. This is important, since you need the box to be visible from the remote’s standpoint so that it can receive infrared communications. Putting the box behind a console or decoration will interrupt the remote’s signal.</p><p> Everything is made of a matte black plastic that doesn’t stand out. Nothing screams luxury, but for under $30, it doesn’t look bad at all. It’s just a tiny box with a small remote. On the back of the box, the only ports you’ll see are one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI output <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and one micro USB power port.</p><p> The remote itself is comfortable to hold, with a minimalist button layout. It has direct buttons to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/overview-of-the-netflix-streaming-service-1847831" >Netflix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , ESPN, Sling TV, and Hulu, and you can navigate to any of Roku’s myriad other apps, but there are some key quality of life features missing on this remote. Notably, it lacks the volume control buttons that the Roku Express’s more grown-up siblings offer, and there’s no voice control or programmable buttons.</p><p> For only $30, it has a stellar library of content, and its clean unbiased interface makes it a pleasure to use.</p><p> The exceptionally cheap price tag is also reflected in the quality of the other extras. The HDMI cable is incredibly flimsy, as are the micro USB cable. However, if they seldom move, they shouldn’t break and they’ll get the job done. Besides, I have to give credit to Roku for including any cables at all for a budget product.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-simple-to-get-started"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-simple-to-get-started" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and simple to get started"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and simple to get started</strong></h2><p> Roku’s included guide is great. It’s full of diagrams and photos to answer any basic questions you may have about positioning or connection. The actual setup process is similarly simple. Use the micro USB cable to power your Express box, connect the box to an open HDMI port on your TV, and make sure your TV’s on the right output.</p><p> Downloading your favorite apps is easy. Just go to the Streaming Channels menu and look through the available channels, or use the search bar if you have a specific channel in mind.</p><p> If you want to restrict the ability to download apps or make purchases on the Express, it’s easy to do so. Roku lets you set up a PIN that you’ll need to enter every time you try to download or buy something, which should deter your children or pets from buying anything without your permission.</p><h2 id="Streaming-Performance-Solid-1080p-content-but-long-buffer-times"><a href="#Streaming-Performance-Solid-1080p-content-but-long-buffer-times" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Performance: Solid 1080p content, but long buffer times"></a><strong>Streaming Performance: Solid 1080p content, but long buffer times</strong></h2><p> For $30, the Roku Express delivers<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/720p-1080i-1080p-explained-3276378" >1080p content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to your TV. The 2019 model has the same specs as the 2018 model, but it consumes less power (so little that you can power it from your TV directly).</p><p> Once you have a show lined up and streaming, the image quality and buffer times are great. However, browsing through Roku’s channels can be slow and at times frustrating due to its paltry connection speed. Large, bloated channels like Netflix suffer the most, and buffer times before a video starts can be upwards of five seconds.</p><p> However, we didn’t have any crashing issues with the Roku Express, and while slow, performance was smooth. Videos and channels did load, eventually. It’s a budget streamer with patient performance, but it’s serviceable if you can’t spend an extra twenty dollars on a more upgraded streamer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Kfml_LPtHefv5s-BdnKptfzmw3s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Roku_02-a744cef9b4b14025bcd288fca6b25f11.jpg"                      alt="Roku Express"                ></p><p> Lifewire&#x2F;Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993651">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993651">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993651%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993651/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-One-of-the-easiest-to-navigate"><a href="#Software-One-of-the-easiest-to-navigate" class="headerlink" title="Software: One of the easiest to navigate"></a><strong>Software: One of the easiest to navigate</strong></h2><p> Roku Express runs with the same Roku interface as its more expensive cousins, and it’s well-loved for a reason. Compared to Fire TV, Chromecast, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-tv-1994193" >Apple TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Roku has the widest selection of apps available, and it doesn’t favor one streaming service over another.</p><p> Roku’s menus are easy to navigate, with clearly labeled categories and large icons. There’s apps for all the major paid streaming platforms, from Netflix to HBO, and there’s a lot of free apps, or channels, with excellent content available to stream.</p><p> On<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/vudu-adds-tv-shows-on-demand-1847424" >Vudu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Roku Channel, Crackle, NewsON, Pluto TV, and more, you’ll get free shows and movies to stream. How are they free? Instead of making money off subscriptions, they make money from ads, so it’s a lot like watching content on regular cable TV. I personally really enjoy the news and educational apps on Roku Express, which are full of engaging content for relatively few intrusions. And if you’re into cheesy kung-fu B-movies, my dad never seems to stop finding new ones on his Roku Streaming Stick+. No matter what you’re into, there’s a free channel for you out there.</p><p> You need the box to be visible from the remote’s standpoint so that it can receive infrared communications.</p><p> An interesting software perk from Roku that its competition doesn’t offer is its mobile app. You can use it as a remote for your Roku device, and that’s great, but more interestingly, you can also plug in your headphones and have the audio stream to your phone. If you like to stay up late and watch TV while your spouse sleeps, this is a great feature to have on hand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657400/16446" target="_top" id="1657400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657400/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Highly-affordable"><a href="#Price-Highly-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Highly affordable"></a><strong>Price: Highly affordable</strong></h2><p> The Roku Express is only $30, but it’s easy to find it for even cheaper in physical stores and even online during sales seasons. It’s not hard to nab it for $25 or less.</p><p> For only $10 to $20 more, you get a faster experience and more functionality out of Roku’s other offerings, so if you can afford it, the Premiere and Streaming Stick+ are the better value.

The Streaming Stick+ runs all the same channels that the Express runs, so you’ll get a wealth of free content and support for all your subscriptions.</p><p> Compared to the budget Chromecast and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-4152887" >Fire TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offerings, the Roku Express offers a sleeker user interface. Both Roku and Fire TV offers many more channels than Chromecast, and they have a physical remote with a real interface to navigate. It’s old-fashioned, but I’ve always found it easier and more enjoyable than using your phone to control devices.</p><p> Roku and Fire TV are a lot more similar to each other than they are to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-chromecast-2438213" >Chromecast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but there are some key differences. The Roku Express excels in having a great, comprehensive search algorithm that’s platform-agnostic, and its user interface is easy to navigate. Fire TV tries to guide you toward Amazon content, and its interface is a little more cumbersome to get around, but even the base model has volume control and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa voice controls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Fire TV also has a better games collection, if that’s something that interests you. As far as quantity and quality of content goes, Roku and Fire TV offer virtually the same apps and channels (over 5,000 of them, to be exact).</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A cheap way to stream 1080p content with ease.</strong></p><p> The Roku Express is a cheap way to turn a dumb TV into a smart TV, or simply to access thousands of free shows that you may not have available directly from your TV’s apps. For only $30, it has a stellar library of content, and its clean unbiased interface makes it a pleasure to use. However, its lack of 4K support and slow performance may make it worth considering an upgrade to its $50 sibling, the Roku Streaming Stick+.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Express</li><li>Product Brand  Roku</li><li>Price  $30.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2019</li><li>Product Dimensions  2.8 x 1.5 x 0.8 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Platform  Roku UI</li><li>Resolution  1920x1080</li><li>Ports  HDMI, micro-USB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-board-features-across-apple-android-and-windows-for-effective-online-collaboration/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating Board Features Across Apple, Android & Windows for Effective Online Collaboration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-premium-selection-top-15-cameras-for-action/"><u>[Updated] Premium Selection Top 15 Cameras for Action</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-jackery-powerbar-hub-the-added-benefits-of-a-built-in-outlet/"><u>All You Need to Know About the Jackery PowerBar Hub – The Added Benefits of a Built-In Outlet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/amaze-with-amazon-fire-tv-cube-the-pinnacle-of-rapid-streaming-devices/"><u>Amaze with Amazon Fire TV Cube: The Pinnacle of Rapid Streaming Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/amazon-vs-samsung-tablets-finding-the-best-device-for-your-needs/"><u>Amazon Vs.

Its 7-inch display features OLED technology, which means a sharper and more vibrant image.</p><p> Having pixels that light up individually to each other means you get brighter colors and deeper blacks, so it looks far better in portable mode. The Nintendo Switch isn’t generally a visual powerhouse, but its game catalog is often vibrant, cute, and gorgeous on the right screen.</p><p> Playing games on the Switch OLED felt a bit more exciting. It might only be a visual improvement, but games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Wonder deserve to be presented in the best possible light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JW7hKEf91vIUGcKyO4x2xMI4paw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchLiteandSwitchOLED2-7589f20a94af406bb9df98aaaa23cd19.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite and Switch OLED gaming consoles."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> After upgrading from the Switch Lite to the Switch OLED, I replayed games to see how prettier they looked.</p><p> Due to the lack of a dock, you’re also dependent on connecting to the internet via Wi-Fi only when using a Switch Lite, compared to the Switch OLED, which has an Ethernet port. Similarly, there’s no way to connect the Switch Lite via HDMI, so you won’t be able to stream games from it.</p><p> The Switch OLED also has 64GB of internal storage compared to 32 GB on the Switch Lite, but in both cases, you can upgrade the storage with microSD cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Flexibility-Advantage-OLED"><a href="#Flexibility-Advantage-OLED" class="headerlink" title="Flexibility: Advantage OLED"></a>Flexibility: Advantage OLED</h2><p> The most significant difference between the Nintendo Switch OLED and the Switch Lite is its flexibility.</p><p> The Switch Lite is solely a portable gaming device. It works brilliantly for that, as I found when playing through many games while bedridden while recovering from surgery.</p><p> It’s very light to hold and isn’t too bulky, even for smaller hands. That’s why it’s particularly appealing to children, further helped by its plasticky shell, which feels like it can handle a few accidental drops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oxjDIc3a44xGYBV83bA1QcvlmXE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchOLED-074355b02db54dd1bb3e701d5674a9cb.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch OLED gaming console."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> The Nintendo Switch OLED is bulkier but can connect to your TV via the dock. Doing so lets you play multiplayer games once you unhook the Joy-Con controllers and gives you a bigger-screen experience compared to the Switch Lite.</p><p> Only one person at a time can play the Switch Lite, and you can’t detach the controllers, which means certain games won’t function with the Switch Lite—at least not unless you use separate Joy-Con controllers.</p><h2 id="Switch-Lite-Limited-Games"><a href="#Switch-Lite-Limited-Games" class="headerlink" title="Switch Lite: Limited Games"></a>Switch Lite: Limited Games</h2><p> The Switch Lite is helpful if you want a games console to use while traveling or to hand to your kids before a long journey.</p><p> However, if you plan to play games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on your TV for the whole family to join in, you’ll need the Switch or Switch OLED.</p><p> I tried playing multiplayer games on the Switch Lite by connecting a spare pair of Joy-Con controllers, but it’s a frustratingly small screen to do so.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TmYyOgzBYexzwHM_D35w2XJF68c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchLite1-33b6996f36534d1da9974a460e6c5139.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite gaming console."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094418/7443" target="_top" id="2094418">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094418" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094418/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> The Switch Lite is not compatible with the following games:</p><ul><li>1-2-Switch</li><li>All Just Dance games</li><li>Super Mario Party</li><li>Fitness Boxing</li><li>Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm &amp; Exercise</li><li>Ring Fit Adventure</li><li>Nintendo Switch Sports</li><li>Nintendo Labo (all sets)</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1484963">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484963">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1484963%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484963/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Thoughts-Each-Model-Has-Its-Advantages"><a href="#Final-Thoughts-Each-Model-Has-Its-Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts: Each Model Has Its Advantages"></a>Final Thoughts: Each Model Has Its Advantages</h2><p> There’s no bad Nintendo Switch console.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Netgear’s Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender (EX7300v2) hits a sweet spot when it comes to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wifi-extenders-4043312" >Wi-Fi signal extenders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It has a wall-plug design yet hits higher speeds than some of the simpler plug-in models out there, however, it isn’t as large as some of the extenders that are nearly as sizable as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> themselves.</p><p> It also has advanced technologies such as MU-MIMO and beamforming, so it feels like a fully capable device. You’ll pay a bit more for this one compared to some of the entry-level plug-in Wi-Fi extenders, but if your home is plagued by wireless dead zones or you just want to ensure a more consistent high-speed signal throughout your dwelling, then this is a strong option. I tested the Netgear Nighthawk X4 for several days in my house for a variety of needs, including everyday work, playing online games, and streaming media.</p><h2 id="Design-Hearty-but-still-compact"><a href="#Design-Hearty-but-still-compact" class="headerlink" title="Design: Hearty, but still compact"></a><strong>Design: Hearty, but still compact</strong></h2><p> At just over 6 inches tall and 3 inches wide, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender might look a little too large to hang from a wall outlet, but most of the weight is concentrated at the base where it plugs in. It’ll only take up one plug on an outlet, leaving the other free, and it stayed securely in place during use.</p><p> Netgear opted for an angular approach here with some tapered elements, and most of the sides are covered in tiny air vents to ensure that this powerful little plug-in has the ventilation that it needs. On the front are lights that indicate the strength of the signal and show network activity, as well as power and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> switch indicators.</p><p> On the left side are On&#x2F;Off and WPS connectivity buttons, as well as a switch that lets you swap between using the device as an extender (to repeat an existing Wi-Fi signal) or an access point, which would create a wireless network from a plugged-in Ethernet cable from your modem. That<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is on the bottom of the device, and when in the typical extender mode, you can use it to plug in a wired device to access the wireless network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ahWiBPBlk75slmsmgc-c4cnSgf8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkX4_03-6a6cab81b4ec4da39c89aa3a92cb1f16.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X4 (EX7300) Wi-Fi Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-setup-awkward-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-setup-awkward-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple setup, awkward app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple setup, awkward app</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Netgear Nighthawk X4 essentially means capturing the signal from your Wi-Fi router and then finding an ideal spot to place the extender to bring Wi-Fi into dead zones and areas with an inconsistent signal.</p><p> There are three ways to do this. Starting with the extender plugged in near your router, you can set it up by following the prompts in Netgear’s Nighthawk mobile app for iOS or Android, by doing the same via a web interface on your computer, or by using the WPS button on both the extender and router. The last option is the simplest, as the devices can automatically pair via a button found on the extender and basically any modern router.</p><p> While the setup process is straightforward, the Nighthawk mobile app itself was a bit wonky.</p><p> I set mine up using the iOS app, and while the process is straightforward, the Nighthawk app itself was a bit wonky. I had to try connecting to the router’s setup network several times before it went through, and it just seemed inconsistently responsive throughout. Ultimately, however, I was able to finish the setup process.</p><p> Once that is complete, you can unplug the extender and find a new place for it in your home. Netgear advises placing it about halfway between your router and the dead zone(s) that you’re trying to address, but you may need to play around with positioning based on the design of your home and potential obstructions that could weaken the signal. If you’re not getting the signal boost that you expect, then try another plug location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rfn4cAzCyxeBXmoIx0VVBH7R0w8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkX4_04-188447741dad41d7a4c51fd7c71861f2.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123736/7443" target="_top" id="2123736">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123736" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123736/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Steady-stellar-speeds"><a href="#Connectivity-Steady-stellar-speeds" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Steady, stellar speeds"></a><strong>Connectivity: Steady, stellar speeds</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X4 worked as advertised, delivering strong speeds, improving upon the signal available from the router in the further corners of my house, and even holding a 5GHz signal pretty well when a fair distance away from the extender. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (multiple user, multi-in multi-out) design allows for more simultaneous signals while beamforming helps hone a signal towards its requesting device. All told, these technological advancements seem to help deliver strong wireless performance.</p><p> Even though I paired it with a TP-Link router, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 maintained the same network names as my router uses. My smartphone and laptop automatically switched to the stronger signal when plugged in. Beyond the speed difference, I could tell when I plugged in the extender and saw the 5GHz network jump from a steady 2 bars to a full 4 bars once the extender was fully powered on.</p><p> Typically, 2.4GHz networks are slower but offer wider range, while the faster 5GHz networks don’t stretch quite as far. Luckily, the extender helps negate the latter issue and can give you more of that 5GHz speed in more places of your home. In my case, a speed test in my office with the extender in place revealed a download speed of 89Mbps with the 2.4GHz network, but then 203Mbps on the 5GHz network.</p><p> Technological advancements such as MU-MIMO and beamforming seem to help deliver strong wireless performance.</p><p> Distance testing revealed that the 5GHz network continued to provide strong speeds even approximately 75 feet away from the extender. Testing in my extended backyard with just one wall between my laptop and the extender, I saw download speeds of 38Mbps at 25 feet, 27Mbps at 50 feet, and 16Mbps at 75 feet on 2.4GHz. However, the 5GHz network gave me 132Mbps at 25 feet, 81Mbps at 50 feet, and 75Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Online gaming was also smooth across the board with the Netgear Nighthawk X4. I saw a typical ping of around 38 with both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz extended networks in Rocket League, and a couple points faster when plugged into the Ethernet port. I played several matches across the configuration options and encountered no sluggishness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ugGkkd4SJutt9ZSqg6hsgakNAAU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkX4_05-8a00f82288884d71bd867f253500e04f.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130885/7443" target="_top" id="2130885">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130885" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130885/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-investment"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-investment" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the investment"></a><strong>Price: Worth the investment</strong></h2><p> At an MSRP of $150 but often seen now for $130, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender costs a fair bit more than a simpler entry-level extender, but the strong performance—especially on the 5GHz band—makes it a worthy investment if you plan on playing online games or streaming extensive media. There are much cheaper Wi-Fi extenders out there, however (like the one below), if your needs aren’t very extensive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X4-vs-TP-Link-RE200"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X4-vs-TP-Link-RE200" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X4 vs. TP-Link RE200"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X4 vs. TP-Link RE200</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tp-link-re200wi-fi-range-extender-review-4846136" >TP-Link’s RE200 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view at<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/42300087" >Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is similar in its plug-in approach, but it’s much smaller and costs a fraction of the price at $30. It also gave me solid connectivity on 2.4GHz, although the 5GHz performance left something to be desired.</p><p> The other annoyance was the fact that it creates separate wireless networks for the extender if you don’t have one of the recent, compatible TP-Link routers. That can cause headaches with needing to switch between networks based on where you are in your home. On the other hand, it’s $30. If you just want to push your Wi-Fi into an additional room or two for web browsing and Netflix, then don’t feel obligated to spend $100+ on an extender.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A strong mid-range Wi-Fi extender.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender finds a pretty ideal middle ground in the Wi-Fi extender market, delivering a strong performance that’s better than what you’ll likely get from a cheap, entry-level extender. Better yet, it’s not as pricey as some of the higher-end devices out there. If you don’t want to commit to a full mesh network upgrade to your home and just want a strong, reliable extender to complement an existing Wi-Fi router, then this is the extender to buy.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk X4 AC2200 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender (EX7300)</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  EX7300v2</li><li>Price  $149.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.3 x 3.2 x 1.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  2 year</li><li>Ports  1x Ethernet</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-canva-expertise-10-sneak-peek-tips-for-photo-editors-for-2024/"><u>[New] Canva Expertise 10 Sneak Peek Tips for Photo Editors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-optimizing-large-scale-video-migrations-from-iphone-to-mac-systems/"><u>[New] Optimizing Large-Scale Video Migrations From iPhone to Mac Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-getting-started-with-snapchat-on-apple-computers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Getting Started with Snapchat on Apple Computers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-chromebook-voice-alteration-guide-essential-online-reverb-and-pitch-tools/"><u>2024 Approved Chromebook Voice Alteration Guide Essential Online Reverb & Pitch Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/choosing-the-right-iphone-for-serious-gamers/"><u>Choosing the Right iPhone for Serious Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-netgear-nighthawk-x6-ac3200-triple-band-speed-demon-and-easy-setup/"><u>Comprehensive Guide: Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 - Triple Band, Speed Demon & Easy Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-why-the-google-pixelbook-go-stands-out-despite-pricey-tag/"><u>Comprehensive Review: Why the Google Pixelbook Go Stands Out Despite Pricey Tag</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-the-power-of-darktable-a-professional-free-alternative-to-manipulate-raw-photographs-on-os-x-and-linux-systems/"><u>Discover the Power of Darktable - A Professional Free Alternative to Manipulate RAW Photographs on OS X & Linux Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/elevate-your-experience-windows-11-home-to-pro/"><u>Elevate Your Experience: Windows 11 Home to Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/gratuita-conversao-de-imagens-tga-online-com-o-movavi/"><u>Gratuita Conversão De Imagens TGA Online Com O Movavi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/illuminate-creativity-spk10-037s-flexible-brilliant-glow/"><u>Illuminate Creativity: SPK10-037's Flexible, Brilliant Glow</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-motorola-moto-g-stylus-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-dynamic-diversity-30plus-fresh-biographical-strategies-to-triple-your-views-following-on-tiktok-filmora-platform/"><u>In 2024, Dynamic Diversity 30+ Fresh Biographical Strategies to Triple Your Views, Following on TikTok-Filmora Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/moto-g-play-assessment-a-closer-look-at-its-long-lasting-charge-and-effective-operational-prowess/"><u>Moto G Play Assessment - A Closer Look at Its Long-Lasting Charge and Effective Operational Prowess</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/profound-inspection-the-detailed-review-of-bublcams-360-camera/"><u>Profound Inspection The Detailed Review of Bublcam's 360 Camera</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/question/"><u>Question:</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/structuring-healthful-eating-routines-with-chatgpt/"><u>Structuring Healthful Eating Routines With ChatGPT</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Read on to see our results.</em></p><p> The Mac mini (M1, 2020) is the first Mac desktop to receive Apple’s new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/why-apple-designed-the-m1-chip-5087225" >ARM-based M1 chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s also the most affordable way to dip your toe into the brave new world of Apple Silicon, even though it’s powered by the exact same chip found in the much more expensive MacBook Pro. It can’t<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/using-boot-camp-assistant-install-windows-2260115" >run Windows apps via Bootcamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like an Intel Mac, and there will be some growing pains as developers switch gears and start catering to the new hardware, but that hardware offers tremendous raw performance, excellent potential in the long term, and more than acceptable real-world performance in the short term.</p><p> While I was a bit skeptical of Apple’s decision to leave Intel behind, the promised performance of their custom silicon left me eager to dig in and see how that raw power really translates into real-world situations. I was able to spend about a week with an M1 Mac mini as my main work machine, plugging in my keyboard and monitors, with my primary rig left to gather dust for the duration.</p><p> During my time with the M1 Mac mini, I paid close attention to performance, of course, with a special eye to how well it handles non-native apps and apps that were designed for iOS. The lack of support for Bootcamp meant I wasn’t able to completely leave my old hardware behind, but there’s no getting around it: this is some impressive hardware at any price, let alone a price tag that’s cheaper than the previous iteration of the hardware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/aEGPK4B55KCbhrof83878utZpZQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-2-16eb4e84f8694bb6a76cf078906add40.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815678/21290" target="_top" id="1815678">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815678" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815678/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Same-sleek-aluminum-chassis"><a href="#Design-Same-sleek-aluminum-chassis" class="headerlink" title="Design: Same sleek aluminum chassis"></a>Design: Same sleek aluminum chassis</h2><p> The big changes here are all under the hood, as Apple opted to leave the overall design of the Mac mini (M1, 2020) unchanged from the previous model. It’s still a block of milled aluminum with the same rounded corners, satin finish, and shiny Apple logo emblazoned on the top. The top is smooth and unmarked aside from the logo, and the front and sides of the case are completely featureless aside from a small LED on the front that lets you know when the system is powered on.</p><p> The ports are all found around the back, where the aluminum case is cut away to accommodate a black plastic panel. There you’ll find a power button and socket for the power cable, an Ethernet port, two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >USB-C&#x2F;Thunderbolt 3 ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an HDMI port, two USB type A ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Situated just below this array of inputs is a cutout that reveals the internal heatsink.</p><p> The biggest change here from the last iteration of the hardware is that the last Mac mini featured four Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of just two. The configuration of the ports is even the same, drawing attention to the fact that just two ports occupy space that could easily support twice that number.</p><p> The bottom of the M1 Mac mini also remains unchanged from the last version of the hardware, with most of it taken up by a circular plastic cover that’s designed to allow easier access to the internals. As before, it causes the Mac mini to stand up a bit from whatever surface you place it on, and it has very little gripping power. If you place it on a slick surface, be aware that it could slide off with the slightest nudge.</p><p> Unlike the previous model, the M1 Mac mini doesn’t have any user serviceable parts or components. That means you’re stuck with the memory and storage configurations you choose at check out, and you can’t go back in later to add extra RAM or a bigger SSD.</p><p> The biggest disappointment here, aside from the fact that the M1 Mac mini didn’t receive any sort of aesthetic update, is that Apple removed two Thunderbolt ports and the ability to upgrade your memory. The first isn’t that big of an issue, since the Mac mini looked great before and still looks great. The lack of Thunderbolt ports, similarly, isn’t a huge deal, because there are a ton of ways to get around such a limitation. The lack of upgradeability certainly removes a degree of flexibility from the hardware, though, making it much more important to select the amount of memory and storage that you’ll be comfortable with for the life of the device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xpt3pmIvU6FTBUo0tBDpyp3BERE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-3-844f657110aa424db6f1e5bac1b19eda.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105874/7443" target="_top" id="2105874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-painless-but-you-can’t-use-a-Bluetooth-keyboard-or-mouse"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-painless-but-you-can’t-use-a-Bluetooth-keyboard-or-mouse" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and painless, but you can’t use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse"></a>Setup Process: Fast and painless, but you can’t use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse</h2><p> If you’ve ever set up a macOS device before, the setup process isn’t any different here. It’s just a matter of accepting some terms, tweaking some initial settings, and connecting your Apple ID. As always, setup is going to be easier if you have access to another functional piece of Apple hardware that you’re already logged into.</p><p> The one wrinkle that you may run into is that you can’t set up the Mac mini with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. You’ll need to plug a wired keyboard and mouse in to complete the setup process and then pair your Bluetooth hardware, or use a keyboard and mouse combo that uses a wireless dongle.</p><p> For example, I was able to plug in the dongle from my Logitech K400+ Touch Keyboard, and the Mac mini recognized the peripheral immediately. That allowed me to complete the setup process without digging around for wired peripherals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151893/7443" target="_top" id="2151893">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151893" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151893/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Unreal-performance-with-some-hiccups"><a href="#Performance-Unreal-performance-with-some-hiccups" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Unreal performance with some hiccups"></a>Performance: Unreal performance with some hiccups</h2><p> While the Mac mini (M1, 2020) remained mostly unchanged from a design perspective, the internals received a massive overhaul. This is Apple’s first desktop to receive its new M1 chip, and that’s a really big deal. Though one of the M1’s headline features, reduced power use, isn’t as big a deal here as it is in the MacBook Air, this chip is still massively more powerful than anything you’ve ever seen in a Mac before. In fact, the Mac mini has the exact same chip as the MacBook Pro, with one more GPU core than the MacBook Air.</p><p> The M1 CPU features eight cores, including four performance cores and four efficiency cores, and the same chip also includes an eight core GPU.</p><p> This isn’t an Intel integrated graphics situation, though. The M1 boasts some pretty impressive processing power from both the CPU and GPU components. In real world terms, that translates to silky-smooth day to day operation from Big Sur, fast-loading and running apps, speedy video rendering and image editing, and intriguing possibilities in the realm of gaming.</p><p> While the numbers Apple has tossed around have been impressive, and my own experience with the M1 hardware was almost uniformly positive, I had to run some benchmarks. First up, I ran the Cinebench multi-core test. The Mac mini achieved a score of 7,662 in that test, putting it between an Intel Xeon E5-2697 at 3GHz and an X5650 Xeon processor at 3.66Ghz. That’s almost within spitting distance of an eight core AMD Ryzen 7 1700X, but only about half the score of a 1950X Threadripper.</p><p> For a processor in a mini-computer at this price range, the M1 turned in decent enough multi-core numbers. When running the single-core Cinebench test though, decent goes right out the window. In that test, the M1 Mac mini scored 1,521, which is the second highest score Cinebench has on record.</p><p> I also ran a few gaming benchmarks from GFXBench Metal. I started with Car Chase, which is a benchmark that simulates a 3D game with advanced shaders, lighting effects, and more. The M1 Mac mini scored a decent 60.44fps in that test, which would be entirely playable if we were dealing with a real game and not a benchmark. It scored a nearly identical 60fps in the less-intense T-Rex benchmark.</p><p> In addition to GFXBench, I also ran the WildLife benchmark from 3DMark that’s designed for iOS, made possible by Big Sur’s native support for iOS applications. In that test, the Mac mini scored 17,930 overall and registered 107fps. Both numbers were a bit higher than the MacBook Air managed on the same test, which is understandable since the Mac mini GPU has one more core.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/H6vCqcN2s5HOQG5MJWawrPxairg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-6-cd1693bee2f4429fafd1a57ecffbce81.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Gaming-Limited-but-promising"><a href="#Gaming-Limited-but-promising" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: Limited but promising"></a>Gaming: Limited but promising</h2><p> This is one area where Apple’s decision to switch from Intel to their own bespoke silicon is unlikely to pay off for a while. The issue is that while the M1 chip is powerful, it’s going to take a while for game developers to offer any kind of real support for it. That means the already anemic Mac gaming scene could be even more anemic until devs see a reason to put substantial resources into games that run natively on the ARM-based M1 hardware. In the long term, cross-compatibility between macOS and iOS apps could end up being a massive game-changer.</p><p> Since the gaming scene was already anemic on macOS, a lot of gaming on Macs is really done in Windows via Bootcamp. If you do a lot of gaming on your current Mac, you’re probably familiar with big tentpole video game titles that never make it off Windows in the first place, and afterthought macOS ports that are poorly optimized and run a whole lot better if you just play the same game on the same hardware in Windows.</p><p> With the switch to ARM-based architecture, the Mac mini no longer provides the option to run Windows alongside macOS, so that gaming option is gone. Windows can’t run on this hardware, so the only way to play Windows-only games is through a virtual machine environment, which is not a good way to play games. That means you just won’t be able to play some games if you rely on a Mac mini, or any M1-based Mac, as your only gaming rig.</p><p> The issue is that while the M1 chip is powerful, it’s going to take a while for game developers to offer any kind of real support for it.</p><p> However, thanks to Rosetta 2, the Mac mini can play any game that’s designed to run in macOS on an Intel machine. There’s some level of performance cost involved, but I wasn’t able to notice it with any of the games I played. Notably, I was able to run<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using Rosetta 2 and then download and play macOS games through Steam seamlessly.</p><p> Civilization 6 is currently in the middle of a nearly year-long content drip, and I was able to fire it up via Rosetta 2 and Steam with zero issues. Even with the world size cranked up all the way, more civs than recommended, and maxed out city states, the M1 sailed along effortlessly with fast load times and tolerably snappy AI turns.</p><p> For something less demanding, yet much more fast-paced, I fired up Rocket League. Though Psyonix technically no longer supports macOS, I was able to download and launch through Steam, and set up a local match. It ran without a hitch, with zero slowdown or stuttering as the cars zipped around the arena at breakneck pace.</p><p> The last game I tried out was Streets of Rage 4, the long-awaited fourth entry in the Streets of Rage series that finally arrived earlier this year. The fast-paced online brawler ran just as smoothly as it does on my Windows gaming rig, with no lag or slow down at all.</p><p> Aside from lack of support from game developers, the only real drawback here in terms of gaming comes from the HDMI port itself. While the M1 Mac mini can pump out<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. That’s fine for most casual gamers, but anyone who has fallen in love with their high refresh rate monitor will experience a bit of pain here.</p><h2 id="Productivity-Ready-for-work"><a href="#Productivity-Ready-for-work" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Ready for work"></a>Productivity: Ready for work</h2><p> The great thing about the Mac mini line is that it’s always been so flexible. You can use a Mac mini for work, but the size and relative affordability of the hardware means you aren’t locked into using it that way. If you do aim to use an M1 Mac mini for work though, it’s more than up to the task. Native apps and the operating system itself run fast and smooth as you could possibly hope, with none of the sitting around looking at spinning beach balls that you may have gotten used to with older hardware.</p><p> Thanks to the emulation offered by Rosetta 2, the M1 offers most tools people will need for productivity. If you currently run an app in macOS on older hardware, Rosetta 2 will allow you to run it on an M1 Mac mini until a native app arrives. And even if a native app doesn’t arrive, your productivity shouldn’t be affected too much.</p><p> I was able to run apps like Photoshop and Lightroom through Rosetta 2 without a hitch or even a hint of slowdown.</p><p> Those are both examples of apps that will get native -versions, according to Adobe, but they run pretty well under Rosetta 2 in the meantime.</p><p> Multitasking also works flawlessly, and I was able to juggle an impressive number of browser windows, intensive apps like Photoshop and Handbrake, voice and video chat over Discord, and more without running into any real problems.</p><h2 id="Audio-It’s-there-if-you-need-it"><a href="#Audio-It’s-there-if-you-need-it" class="headerlink" title="Audio: It’s there if you need it"></a>Audio: It’s there if you need it</h2><p> The M1 Mac mini is great in almost every category, but audio isn’t one of them. There’s a speaker inside that sleek aluminum block, but it isn’t one you’ll care to listen to. It’s tinny and hollow, and absolutely a placeholder for more capable external speakers. You’ll want to hook up headphonesor some kind of speakers or soundbar shortly after setting the M1 Mac mini up, because the built-in speaker isn’t really even suitable for watching YouTube videos, let alone listening to music or streaming your favorite shows or movies.</p><p> The M1 Mac mini does include a 3.5mm headphone jack on the back along with built-in Bluetooth, so you have a lot of options. Just make sure to budget for some sort of external speakers or headphones, because you don’t want to get stuck with the built-in speaker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OZrKjTPGUmo00carhaedBa9WhTU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-5-bc84da59dfdf440c8d53a096509c232b.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Network-Solid-Ethernet-and-Wi-Fi-6-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Solid-Ethernet-and-Wi-Fi-6-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Solid Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity"></a>Network: Solid Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</h2><p> The Mac mini includes a wired gigabit Ethernet jack, support for Bluetooth 5.0, and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network card that’s also 801.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac compatible. Performance from the wired and wireless networking options was uniformly strong, with fast download speeds and no issues streaming 4K video or video chatting.</p><p> To test the M1 Mac mini’s network capabilities, I used a gigabit connection from Mediacom that measured just shy of 1Gbps at the modem at the time of testing. First I hooked up to the router via Ethernet and checked the speed using the Speedtest app from Ookla. With the wired connection, the M1 Mac mini turned in an impressive 937Mbps down, which is one of the fastest measurements I’ve seen on this connection. At the same time, it measured an upload speed of 63.7Mbps, which is close to the upper limit of this connection.</p><p> I also tested the wireless connection, hooking the M1 Mac mini to my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/eero-pro-mesh-wi-fi-system-review-4797008" >Eero mesh network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . When connected wirelessly, I measured a respectable 284 Mbps down and 54 Mbps up. At the same time, in the same location, my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hp-spectre-x360-15t-touch-laptop-review-4773540" >HP Spectre x360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> measured 254Mbps down and 63Mbps up.</p><h2 id="Software-So-long-Windows-compatibility"><a href="#Software-So-long-Windows-compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Software: So long, Windows compatibility"></a>Software: So long, Windows compatibility</h2><p> Software is the biggest stumbling block for M1 hardware during these early days, as there isn’t a whole lot out there that’s actually designed to run on Apple Silicon. Big Sur was built specifically for this hardware and to integrate seamlessly with Rosetta 2 for running legacy Intel macOS apps, and a number of first party Apple apps also run natively, but that’s about it at launch.</p><p> I’ve already touched on it a few times, but the biggest casualty of Apple’s move to in-house ARM-based silicon is that the hardware doesn’t let you dual boot Windows, and x86 emulation for Windows apps is also a no-go. The good news is that a new version of Parallels Desktop for Mac that will run on M1 hardware is on the way, but some apps require dual booting, or run poorly in a virtual machine environment, so that won’t solve every problem for everyone.</p><p> Software is the biggest stumbling block for M1 hardware during these early days, as there isn’t a whole lot out there that’s actually designed to run on Apple Silicon.</p><p> The bottom line is that if you currently rely on Bootcamp for a Windows application or utility that you need for work, or even just for gaming, the M1 Mac mini just won’t run that software for you. That may change in the future, as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-runs-so-fast-on-m1-macs-it-s-embarrassing-5089804" >Windows does actually have an ARM version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but for the time being you’re out of luck in that department.</p><p> For the time being, the trade off is that Big Sur and native apps like Safari run extremely well, and with remarkably low power consumption and heat generation compared to Intel Macs.</p><h2 id="Price-More-affordable-than-ever"><a href="#Price-More-affordable-than-ever" class="headerlink" title="Price: More affordable than ever"></a>Price: More affordable than ever</h2><p> The Mac mini saw a price increase alongside its last major retool, but Apple actually played against tradition and handed us a price reduction with the transition to M1 hardware. The baseline M1 Mac mini is actually hundreds of dollars cheaper than the previous iteration of the hardware, which is remarkable considering how much more powerful it is. The last Intel Mac mini was already a good deal, so the even cheaper M1 Mac mini looks even better in comparison. Considering its capabilities, it’s also a good deal when compared to non-Apple mini desktop hardware like the Intel NUC lineup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/G2V98ugnO-cdk-GaL11FUP0RWvo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-7-c899b9f13f09448699fee766ab51a2bd.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135365/19272" target="_top" id="2135365">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135365" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135365/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Mac-Mini-M1-vs-Mac-Mini-Intel"><a href="#Mac-Mini-M1-vs-Mac-Mini-Intel" class="headerlink" title="Mac Mini M1 vs. Mac Mini Intel"></a>Mac Mini M1 vs. Mac Mini Intel</h2><p> This is a bit of an unfair fight, but the fact is that Apple still sells the Intel Mac mini, so it’s a natural comparison to make. The two mini desktops share an identical form factor, with the Intel version coming in Space Gray and the M1 version finished in Silver. The Intel Mac mini has a base price of $1,099 compared to $699 or $899 for the M1 Mac mini.</p><p> The Intel Mac mini is more similar to the $899 model of the M1 hardware since both come with 512GB of storage. They also both have 8GB of RAM. Where the M1 Mac mini has the 8-core M1 chip, the Intel version includes a 6-core Intel Core i5 and integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630.</p><p> In terms of performance, the M1 Mac mini blows the Intel version out of the water. The Intel version does include a couple extra Thunderbolt ports though, and it can do one thing the M1 version can’t: run Windows via Bootcamp.</p><p> If you don’t have any need to run Windows apps, then there’s no real question. The M1 Mac mini is superior, and it costs less. The Intel Mac mini is worth considering if you absolutely need to run Windows apps and don’t mind the extra cost, but the question then becomes whether the Mac mini is really the best platform to be running those Windows apps considering how much more expensive it is than a pure Windows machine of similar capabilities.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mini-pcs-4047271" >The Best Home Theater PCs of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you’re weighing different options, be sure to check out our guide for the best laptops.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>If all you need is a Mac, the M1 Mac mini is your destination.</strong></p><p> The Apple Mac mini with M1 is a tremendously impressive piece of hardware, offering staggering performance at an affordable price. The only real catch here is that in leaving Intel behind, Apple may have left you in the lurch. If you currently can’t get by without running specific apps through Windows by way of Bootcamp, then the M1 Mac mini just isn’t what you’re looking for. If you can live and work in a world that’s entirely free of Windows, then the M1 Mac mini is ready to welcome you home.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137212/26400" target="_top" id="2137212">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137212" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137212/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-air-4-review-5091874" >Apple iPad Air 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Mac Mini</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>UPC  194252091746</li><li>Price  $699.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Weight  2.6 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.7 x 7.7 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Warranty  1 year (limited)</li><li>Processor  Apple M1 chip w&#x2F;8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine</li><li>Storage  256GB SSD (optional 512GB - 2TB)</li><li>RAM  8GB (16GB optional)</li><li>Ports  Power, Ethernet, 2x USB-C&#x2F;Thunderbolt 2, 2xUSB-A HDMI</li><li>Connectivity  Wi-Fi 6, Ethernet</li><li>Software  macOS Big Sur</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-frameflick-recorder-reflection/"><u>[New] FrameFlick Recorder Reflection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-15-techniques-to-ensure-facebook-videos-are-spotlighted/"><u>[New] In 2024, 15 Techniques to Ensure Facebook Videos Are Spotlighted</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-tech-savvy-strategies-recording-gotomeeting-on-any-gear/"><u>[New] In 2024, Tech-Savvy Strategies Recording GoToMeeting on Any Gear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/embracing-the-undead-a-review-on-how-7-days-to-die-successfully-reinvents-classic-zombie-lore-for-modern-gamers/"><u>Embracing the Undead: A Review on How '7 Days to Die' Successfully Reinvents Classic Zombie Lore for Modern Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/evaluating-google-stadias-current-state-and-future-upgrades/"><u>Evaluating Google Stadia's Current State and Future Upgrades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/expensive-savings-not-if-the-user-experience-of-nikon-a10-leaves-you-puzzled/"><u>Expensive Savings?

It’s a thin, plastic rectangular antenna that measures 13 inches wide by nine inches tall. At 0.02 inches in thickness, it’s almost paper-thin, but the plastic feels sturdy enough to withstand regular wear and tear.</p><p> The antenna is reversible, with a light oak finish on one side, and darker wood color on the other. It looks less like an eyesore or something you need to hide, and more like an attractive component, you’re willing to display. The pre-attached coaxial cable comes out of the bottom, which is ideal. You can’t remove the cable from the antenna, which isn’t great for storage, but it does promote stable connectivity.</p><p> The antenna comes with a stand for placement on a desk or entertainment center. It also comes with double-sided adhesives, so you can hang it on a wall or window. The adhesives are extremely sticky—when I pulled the antenna off of my wall, the paint came off along with it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RWXekalxAMy_w61EH_Getqbfiy0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-2-24f94c63d6164dc7a54542cc1e4262c9.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915810/19272" target="_top" id="1915810">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915810" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915810/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Easier-than-most"><a href="#Setup-Easier-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Easier than most"></a><strong>Setup: Easier than most</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is relatively intuitive.

The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to twist onto the threading.

This is perhaps the most difficult part of the setup process. My test home is in a wooded area, and I found the best placement was near or directly on the window.

You generally want a sound card with a signal-to-noise ratio over 100dB, but the best sound cards are in the 124dB range, which is a significant improvement.</p><p><strong>Channels</strong> - Many decent, budget-friendly sound cards typically support 5.1 channel audio, but you can spend a little more to get one that can handle 7.1 surround sound. Some can even up-mix 5.1 channel audio to 7.1, which is excellent if your headphones support 7.1 channels and your audio sources don’t.</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong> - Look for a sound card with the jacks you need to plug in your equipment. Basic sound cards have 3.5mm jacks that work fine with most headphones and headsets, but look for one with RCA jacks or a TOSLINK optical connection if you’re hooking up to audio equipment that requires them.</p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Why does my PC need a sound card?<br> Nearly all computers (desktops and laptops) available in the market feature integrated (on the motherboard) audio functionality, which ensures that both built-in (e.g., speakers) and external (e.g., earphones) work as intended. If you want to use your PC with high-end gear like studio headphones and home theater systems, you need a sound card capable of driving all this additional hardware. It’s also crucial if you want to enjoy high-resolution lossless music.</li><li>Should I go for an internal or an external sound card?<br> Generally speaking, internal sound cards are more powerful. They plug directly into your desktop PC’s motherboard, offering features like switchable op-amp chips and many connectivity ports. However, external sound cards are the way to go if your target device is a laptop PC (or a gaming console).</li><li>Can I install&#x2F;set up the sound card myself?<br> Installing most internal sound cards isn’t hard since you simply plug them into your motherboard’s expansion slot. External sound cards are easier to set up since they usually get powered via a USB port. In both cases, you must configure the associated drivers (if any) to get things up and running.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-iphone-x-security-mending-facial-detection-glitches-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhancing iPhone X Security Mending Facial Detection Glitches for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/he-ultimate-list-mastering-youtubes-best-music-reaction-videos/"><u>[New] The Ultimate List Mastering YouTube's Best Music Reaction Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-picks-unbeatable-xbox-recording-gear/"><u>Best Picks: Unbeatable Xbox Recording Gear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comparing-echo-pop-and-echo-dot-key-distinctions-unveiled/"><u>Comparing Echo Pop and Echo Dot: Key Distinctions Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/elite-selection-of-portable-powerful-minis-for-serious-gamers/"><u>Elite Selection of Portable, Powerful Minis for Serious Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/exploring-the-merits-of-urban-armor-gears-rugged-case-for-your-macbook-professional-device-an-expert-review/"><u>Exploring the Merits of Urban Armor Gear's Rugged Case for Your MacBook Professional Device: An Expert Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-building-an-effective-monetization-plan-for-video-content-on-vimeo/"><u>In 2024, Building an Effective Monetization Plan for Video Content on Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-learning-the-art-of-softly-amplifying-audio-tracks/"><u>In 2024, Learning the Art of Softly Amplifying Audio Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-pushing-boundaries-with-innovative-vsco-techniques/"><u>In 2024, Pushing Boundaries with Innovative VSCO Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-perfect-travel-companion-for-avid-readers-an-in-depth-review-of-the-kobo-clara-hd/"><u>The Perfect Travel Companion for Avid Readers: An In-Depth Review of the Kobo Clara HD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unpacking-the-features-of-maistos-rc-rock-crawler-an-expert-review-on-family-usage/"><u>Unpacking the Features of Maisto's RC Rock Crawler - An Expert Review on Family Usage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-new-imac-m1-cutting-edge-design-meets-impressive-processing-power/"><u>Unveiling the New iMac M1: Cutting-Edge Design Meets Impressive Processing Power</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Kasuga gets into a bit of trouble with a Yakuza family but is saved by Masumi Arakawa, the patriarch of the Arakawa family. Because of this, Kasuga pledges his life to Arakawa, promising to repay the debt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Mo4mMH944CddmYJTyCxtMRxK9-k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_05-e59c99ba9bd249e7a2241f532dd742dc.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> A few years later, Kasuga is asked to confess to a murder that was really committed by one of the Captains in the family. Kasuga spends 18 years in prison for the crime, which brings us to modern day. Once out of prison, Kasuga finds he no longer has a place in the family due to some serious changes that have taken place while he was away. Kasuga is shot and left for dead in the Yokohama area of Isezaki Ijincho. From there, the game opens up as you try to rebuild everything that was lost and find out what happened.</p><p> All of the aforementioned story takes place in what could be called the introductory stages of the game. The intro was incredibly slow and took around five to six hours. Finally, after the long intro, it felt like I was getting into the real meat where the world opens up. Even after the long preamble, I was still introduced to new items, concepts, and parts of the game. It felt like a lot of handholding, which was frustrating at times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_ksFqEWrm3B3MbfrBujuNtLpcXw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_03-37ca82f2a4cd42c4ad65f34e2ca63b68.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> Once things open up, the story gets going in what can only be described as a true modern-day JRPG. It has many of the common tropes of a JRPG, like a party system that allows you to manage those who fight with you, turn-based combat, and a long sweeping epic filled with plenty of side quests.</p><p> Overall, the story is interesting and engaging, with excellent voice acting, and deep and interesting characters.</p><p> Yakuza: Like a Dragon is clearly inspired by games like Dragon Quest. So much so that eventually, and in a truly hilarious fashion, Kasuga begins having delusions of being a hero, and makes it his life’s mission to become a hero who can save everyone around him. These delusions play out in a physical change that takes place over enemies during combat. Their eyes turn red, and their bodies change, but Kasuga is the only one who can see these changes.</p><p> Overall, the story is interesting and engaging, with excellent voice acting and deep and interesting characters. There are plenty of opportunities to get to know the people who travel with you, and you come to care about the characters and their motivations. Yakuza: Like a Dragon is story-rich, and you won’t be disappointed at the amount of content to explore.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-yet-slow-paced-at-times"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-yet-slow-paced-at-times" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, yet slow-paced at times"></a>Gameplay: Fun, yet slow-paced at times</h2><p> Gameplay in Yakuza: Like a Dragon feels incredibly polished. World exploration feels intuitive—you can run from point to point, stopping for distractions along the way, and sometimes engage in a conversation with your party during travel. Yokohama feels alive and real. There are billboards, stores, and people everywhere. You have to be careful when crossing the street, as you can suddenly get hit by a car, which seems to happen more than it should.</p><p> The map is easy to use, and there is a taxi fast-travel system. As you explore, you will find some areas off-limits, but you’ll also find some areas where your level is not high enough to access. For the most part, though, running into enemies is really fun since it throws you into combat.</p><p> The game provides you with a ton of options in the fight, and many of the moves are both over the top and quite funny.</p><p> Combat is handled with a turn-based system. During the fight, you have a menu of different selections, from regular attacks and items to defending and special attacks. This is where Yakuza: Like a Dragon really shines. The game provides you with a ton of options in the fight, and many of the moves are both over the top and quite funny. For instance, you can have a homeless teammate attack with a flock of pigeons, or maybe have your bartender attack with moves from her boxing fitness class.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZvcwNcecc79umImvw53CUJlLvIc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_02-6396bcd8866c4a479331a02e160eb890.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> The moves are creative and fun to use. After selecting the attack, timed button presses may increase the attack’s effectiveness or provide you with bonus damage. When you need a true power attack, you can use your phone to call PoundMates, which is a special “Summoning” move that calls in an ally to do massive damage. There are tons of PoundMates in the game, from a diaper-wearing adult man to a poisonous lobster named Nancy, and calling these special attacks is part of what makes Yakuza fun to play.</p><p> You should be able to finish the main story in around 45 to 55 hours, depending on how fast you run through it, but I highly recommend taking your time and enjoying all the wonderful diversions available.</p><p> There’s a job system, which will let you change the different abilities of your team. This lets you customize your party to fill different roles, like healer or tank. However, in Yakuza, you’ll find some rather interesting jobs. There’s gear as well, but this is pretty standard fare. You’ll encounter a ton of diversions and side quests. Some of the minigames are innovative and comical, but some are also very benign.</p><p> This<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pc-gaming-reviews-4689600" >PC game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> plays just like it should, and the controls are top-notch.

The city looks amazing, with realistic billboards and action.</p><p> During combat, there are graphical flourishes to keep the eyes excited, including damage feedback and hit animations.</p><p> The game ran at a smooth 60fps (I played at<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-the-term-1080p-means-1846837" >1080p resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), and rarely did I come across any graphical issues or bugs. The whole game has a very modern feel but also has so many nods to its JRPG roots.

The price is reasonable for the amount of gameplay. However, you have two other purchase options as well. The Hero Edition, which costs $70, includes the Job Set and the Management Mode set and features two extra jobs and three sets of Management mode employees.</p><p> The Legendary Hero edition costs $90, and it includes both previously listed sets, as well as the Crafting Mat, Stat Boost, Karaoke, and Ultimate Costume sets. These are all nice bonuses and can certainly add to the experience, but you will also find more than enough gameplay in the base game.</p><h2 id="Yakuza-Like-a-Dragon-vs-Dragon-Quest-Series"><a href="#Yakuza-Like-a-Dragon-vs-Dragon-Quest-Series" class="headerlink" title="Yakuza: Like a Dragon vs. Dragon Quest Series"></a>Yakuza: Like a Dragon vs. Dragon Quest Series</h2><p> It’s clear Yakuza: Like a Dragon draws some inspiration from the recent Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest XI. Both games feature turn-based combat, jobs working as roles, and a large sweeping and epic tale. Yakuza: Like a Dragon diverges in one major way, and that is not being afraid to innovate and push the limits of what a JRPG can be. Where Dragon Quest is the basic formula, Yakuza: Like a Dragon is what happens when a mad scientist gets a hold of that formula and creates something both crazy and brilliant.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An entertaining and addictive JRPG.</strong></p><p> A well-crafted masterpiece. Yakuza: Like a Dragon falls into the must-play category for anyone who loves a good story, JRPGs, or a wild game that will make you laugh. It’s definitely a departure from the rest of the series, but that contributes to a lot of the fun and uniqueness of the game.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cyberpunk-2077-review-5113844" >Cyberpunk 2077 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/godfall-review-5095668" >Godfall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/torment-tides-of-numenera-review-5077302" >Torment: Tides of Numenera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Yakuza: Like a Dragon</li><li>Product Brand  SEGA</li><li>SKU  6413107</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Weight  4.1 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  0.6 x 5.4 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Color  N&#x2F;A</li><li>Rating  Mature 17+</li><li>Platform  Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and PC</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-budget-edits-8-no-charge-video-editing-software/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Best Budget Edits 8 No-Charge Video Editing Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-remove-a-desktop-discord-server/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Remove a Desktop Discord Server</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-snapstrategy-101-crafting-effective-ads-for-biz-for-2024/"><u>[New] SnapStrategy 101 Crafting Effective Ads for Biz for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-20-unlimited-cloud-storage-solutions-up-to-1tb/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Top 20 Unlimited Cloud Storage Solutions, Up To 1TB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-media-with-top-5-photo-and-video-apps-on-iosandroid-devices/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering Media with Top 5 Photo & Video Apps on iOS/Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-find-ispoofer-pro-activation-key-on-realme-c53-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Find iSpoofer Pro Activation Key On Realme C53? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-pros-and-cons-of-google-nest-audio-vs-nest-mini/"><u>In Depth Analysis: Pros and Cons of Google Nest Audio Vs.

Read on for our full take.</em></p><p> Nvidia’s RTX 30 series is the hottest thing in PC gaming right now. So hot, in fact, that it’s almost impossible to buy a desktop RTX 30 series graphics card, and even laptops with the hardware are flying off store shelves.</p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is, in many respects, a mid-range gaming laptop, but it succeeds at one very important task: it delivers Nvidia RTX 3060 Max-Q at a reasonable price, and it’s actually in stock not just at, but sometimes below, MSRP. Its value pricing helps the Triton 300 SE stand out against attractive competitors like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049363/7443" target="_top" id="2049363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049363/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Small-but-sturdy"><a href="#Design-Small-but-sturdy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but sturdy"></a>Design: Small but sturdy</h2><p> I’m surprised Acer didn’t slap a “Pro” label on the Predator Triton 300 SE. The spec sheet might scream gaming, but the laptop’s look and feel has more in common with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >business laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The aluminum exterior and simple silver interior keep this laptop subtle. It’s a bit dull, actually, compared to the sleek elegance of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-book-13-review-5176895" >Razer’s Book 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the brash look of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Triton 300 SE measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs a hair less than 3.5 pounds. These figures aren’t unusual in 2021 but are impressive for a laptop packing serious gaming horsepower. It will easily fit in most backpacks or messenger bags, yet packs performance to rival modern game consoles.</p><p> It’s a sturdy little beast, too. The chassis feels slate-like in hand. Holding the laptop up by one corner reveals nearly no flex. The display is the weak point; opening the laptops can cause a few creaks and groans.</p><p> Physical connectivity is a mix of new and old. There are two USB-A 3.2 ports paired with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port that supports DisplayPort Mode and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >Thunderbolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There’s also an HDMI output and a 3.5mm audio jack that handles audio-in and out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RkOepytb4JglYF6g8lqap4lR4Uk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-5-b8c978f2d42a4865be1ea11a4785c104.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> All the laptop’s ports are placed near the front of the chassis. You’ll have to deal with tangled cables more often than with a laptop that places most ports on the rear. I found this annoying when using an external mouse, as cables jutting from the laptop’s flanks often bumped my hand while playing games.</p><h2 id="What’s-New-This-one-is-special"><a href="#What’s-New-This-one-is-special" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: This one is special"></a>What’s New: This one is special</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE has little in common with other Predator Triton or Helios models. A few common design elements can be found in the speaker grill, fans, and PreadtorSense software, but the design is otherwise distinct.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Better-than-first-glance"><a href="#Display-Better-than-first-glance" class="headerlink" title="Display: Better than first glance"></a>Display: Better than first glance</h2><p> I wasn’t immediately impressed by the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s display. It’s not especially bright and has a matte coating, so lacks the brilliant, eye-catching look that is common to high-end laptops with glossy, high-brightness displays.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played.</p><p> Once I loaded a game, though, I liked what I saw. The screen’s resolution is 1080p, but that’s more than enough to provide a sharp, crisp look in modern games. It also supports a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984" >maximum refresh rate of 144Hz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , providing an ultra-smooth look in older titles capable of achieving a high framerate.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played. Games with bright, high-color graphics look vivid, while those with a moody tone look dark and foreboding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eRv5Q4rKutM9zrhSTCRxbBO4rVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-6-2af7f9999ae847bda4f5b9b830c9c555.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S.

I can’t give the Triton 300 SE too much flak for this given its otherwise excellent performance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else"></a>Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s most unusual feature is its Intel Core i7-11375H processor. It’s odd because it has just four cores (running eight threads) but is still sold as a top-tier component. The Core i7-11375H has higher minimum and maximum clock speeds than the comparable Intel Core i7-1165G7 found in thinner notebooks. The i7-11375H can clock as high as 5GHz. My review unit also had 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state hard drive.</p><p> PCMark 10 hit an overall score of 5,534. Geekbench 5 turned in a single-core score of 1,418 and a multi-core score of 4,493.

Smith</p><p> Gaming performance proved more impressive. 3DMark Fire Strike hit a score of 14,462, while Time Spy hit a score of 6,721. The laptop averaged 143 FPS in the GFXBench Car Chase test. It also averaged 74 frames per second in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at high detail with ray-traced shadows off.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ray-tracing-5097484" >Turning ray-traced shadows on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reduced the average to 56 frames per second.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution.</p><p> These numbers may seem disappointing if compared to all RTX 3060 laptops. You can expect more from Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 and the Razer Blade 15. But don’t forget the price. Acer’s laptop significantly undercuts those alternatives. When compared to all gaming laptops, this Acer delivers great performance for the price.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution. I wouldn’t recommend the Triton 300 SE if you plan to use an external 1440p or 4K monitor, however. Pushing a higher pixel count will lead to sub-60fps performance in most demanding games.</p><h2 id="Productivity-All-business"><a href="#Productivity-All-business" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: All business"></a>Productivity: All business</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s business-like design carries over to the keyboard and mouse. Key feel is good, with significant key travel and firm bottoming action, and the spacious layout will be comfortable for most users.</p><p> There is a flaw: some keys are smaller than they could be. The Control, Function, and Windows keys are noticeable examples. It’s an odd decision that can cause confusion when hunting for a keyboard shortcut.</p><p> Keyboard backlighting is standard and set to white by default, but the color can be customized across three zones. It’s not as impressive as the per-key RGB backlighting found on some gaming laptops but I’m happy to see some customization offered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IiMzYmVU-_I6PnObn0bkjyCzqUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-3-7cae0e5d13154048bbc93c40976706ca.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> The touchpad is about four inches wide and two and a half inches deep. That’s not bad for a gaming laptop, but average for a productivity machine, and it can feel cramped. It’s responsive and rejects any quick, unintended brush by a palm or thumb. It’s smooth when using multi-touch gestures like two-finger scroll or pinch-to-zoom.</p><h2 id="Audio-Packing-a-punch"><a href="#Audio-Packing-a-punch" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Packing a punch"></a>Audio: Packing a punch</h2><p> This laptop packs a sonic punch. It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts. Maximum volume is loud enough to fill an office with music and overcome most ambient noise. There’s even a hint of bass that you’ll feel through your fingertips when the volume is cranked up.</p><p> This laptop packs a sonic punch. It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts.</p><p> There are limits, of course. It isn’t loud enough to project impressive volume in a living room or kitchen. It can also sound muddy and confused when playing bass-forward music or the most frantic action games. Still, it’s an impressive set of speakers that will rarely leave you wanting for more.</p><h2 id="Network-Killer-performance"><a href="#Network-Killer-performance" class="headerlink" title="Network: Killer performance"></a>Network: Killer performance</h2><p> Downloading a big, hot new game can be a real hassle, especially over Wi-Fi, but the Triton 300 SE can help. It has Intel’s Killer Wi-Fi 6 AX1650 and let me tell you: this thing rips.</p><p> It delivered network speeds of over 800 megabits per second (Mbps) near my router, which is typical. Every<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345#:~:text=Wi%2DFi%206%20is%20the,Fi%20faster%20and%20more%20reliable." >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> laptop I review manages that. I was impressed by its performance in my detached office, where the Triton 300 SE hit up to 195Mbps. By comparison, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-5179212" >Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hit only 40Mbps in the same space.</p><p> This translated to excellent real-world results. I created a real-world stress test by downloading Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam while simultaneously downloading Metro Exodus on Epic. Surprisingly, both downloads averaged in excess of 25Mbps. I’m used to seeing numbers in the teens.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105882/7443" target="_top" id="2105882">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105882" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105882/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam"><a href="#Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)"></a>Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE straddles the line between entertainment and productivity in its design, but the camera falls short of its professional aspirations. It’s a tiny 720p pinhole camera that squeezes between the display and the top bezel. Video quality is grainy in all but the brightest rooms and uneven lighting can easily confuse it.</p><h2 id="Battery-Ouch"><a href="#Battery-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Ouch"></a>Battery: Ouch</h2><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story. This is a powerful laptop yet, due to its size, it contains a modest 60 watt-hour battery. That would be fine in a laptop without discrete graphics, but this is a gaming laptop.</p><p> I didn’t expect much endurance and received even less. My first effort at using the Triton 300 SE for a workday of writing had me reaching for the power brick after 3 hours. Two further workdays put me at about 3 hours, 30 minutes each.</p><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story.</p><p> In fairness to Acer, there’s little it could do to fix this issue. A slim gaming laptop sucks down a lot of juice even outside of games, yet there’s not much room for a battery. The majority of gaming laptops I’ve tested in recent years have delivered less than 4 hours of real-world endurance, and the worst won’t last 2 hours.</p><p> Still, buyer beware. The Triton 300 SE might look like a productivity laptop, but its battery life is solidly in the realm of full-blown gaming machines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RSfl2dEVmErlvh3BUUFcxqsbt9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-2-c5eed4bfe7e44014952b5503566097d9.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S.

It includes a few touches exclusive to Acer, including a Planet9 wallpaper and a few other icons under the same.</p><p> Despite this, most laptop functions are controlled through the PredatorSense software interface. It can control fan modes, adjust keyboard lighting, and monitor temperatures, among other functions. PredatorSense is not much to look at, but I find it less confusing than the alternatives from Asus and Razer.</p><p> The laptop comes with Norton antivirus installed. It’s eager to remind you of its presence whenever you download a file or visit an unfamiliar website. The antivirus is easy to uninstall, but its presence takes away from what otherwise feels like a special laptop in Acer’s Predator line.</p><h2 id="Price-An-outstanding-value"><a href="#Price-An-outstanding-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An outstanding value"></a>Price: An outstanding value</h2><p> Acer sells the Predator Triton 300 SE for $1,400, and it sometimes sells for $1,350 at Best Buy. This is an outstanding price for a laptop packing Nvidia’s RTX 3060. There’s only a few competitors with the RTX 3060, such as MSI’s GF65 Thin, that can be purchased for less right now. The MSI GF65 manages to undercut the Triton 300 SE by using an older Intel chip and just 8GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14"><a href="#Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14"></a>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE and Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 seem to target the same users. They’re both compact, light 14-inch laptops that pack impressive CPU and GPU horsepower. Although great for gamers, they also appeal to content creators seeking an affordable, portable laptop.</p><p> The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 wins out in design and build quality. It’s an attractive, eye-catching laptop that feels more solid than the already respectable Triton 300 SE. The two laptops trade blows in display, keyboard, touchpad, and connectivity, with neither having a significant edge.</p><p> Game performance is similar, but the Asus G14 embraces AMD processors with up to eight cores. A well-equipped G14 will easily trounce the Acer in multi-core processor tests. Game performance is roughly similar when both are configured with an RTX 3060 graphics chip, with the Asus G14 having a slight edge.</p><p> While the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a better laptop overall, price is a factor. The Asus G14 is sold for $1,500 when configured with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and is harder to find in stock. Paying a bit more for the Asus G14 makes sense to content creators who need its superior processor performance, but gamers could find more value in Acer’s alternative.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Excellent value for an RTX-powered gaming laptop.</strong></p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is an excellent value that has what gamers want: a great gaming experience and a quality display. Its short battery life and mediocre multi-core processor hold it back in everyday use, but the laptop’s competitive price makes these flaws easy to forgive.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-review-5069584" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop-review-4795686" >Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Predator Triton 300 SE</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>MPN  PT314-51s-71UU</li><li>Price  $1,399.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2021</li><li>Weight  3.75 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.7 x 9 x 0.7 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i7-11375H</li><li>RAM  16GB</li><li>Storage  512GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  60 watt-hour</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort mode and ThunderBolt 4, 2x USB-A 3.2, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5mm audio jack</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-fb-live-tv-broadcast-4-innovative-methods/"><u>[New] FB Live TV Broadcast 4 Innovative Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-selective-edits-blurring-images-in-ps/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Selective Edits Blurring Images in PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/are-you-still-using-the-netgear-c3000-heres-why-it-may-be-past-its-prime/"><u>Are You Still Using the Netgear C3000?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is so cumbersome, unsightly, and complicated that I secretly wanted it to fail. Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557746/17382" target="_top" id="1557746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557746/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135351/19272" target="_top" id="2135351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972693/19272" target="_top" id="1972693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972693/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134500/19576" target="_top" id="2134500">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134500" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134500/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-srt-to-subcap-conversion-techniques/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved SRT to SUBCAP Conversion Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-engaging-stories-expanding-audiences-top-three-methods/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Engaging Stories, Expanding Audiences Top Three Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-the-intersection-of-brain-research-and-strategic-business-management-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Intersection of Brain Research and Strategic Business Management for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/assessing-the-merits-why-choose-apple-vision-pro/"><u>Assessing the Merits: Why Choose Apple Vision Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/canon-eos-260ci-successfully-solving-the-wia-driver-usb-malfunction/"><u>Canon EOS 260Ci: Successfully Solving the WIA Driver USB Malfunction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/determining-the-urgency-of-switching-to-ios-17/"><u>Determining the Urgency of Switching to iOS 17</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhanced-sound-quality-with-proper-turn-offs/"><u>Enhanced Sound Quality With Proper Turn-Offs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/galaxy-s10e-analysis-affordable-and-compact-design-shines-through/"><u>Galaxy S10e Analysis: Affordable and Compact Design Shines Through</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-use-snapchat-location-spoofer-to-protect-your-privacy-on-honor-play-8t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Honor Play 8T? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-everything-you-need-to-know-about-unlocked-iphone-xr-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Everything You Need To Know About Unlocked iPhone XR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/maximizing-wi-fi-reach-with-the-netgear-ex3700-an-authoritative-ac750-range-extender-review/"><u>Maximizing Wi-Fi Reach with the Netgear EX3700 - An Authoritative AC750 Range Extender Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/podcast-prowess-apples-airpods-pro-vs-galaxy-buds-pro/"><u>Podcast Prowess: Apple's AirPods Pro Vs.

It explains the situation in Harran, the city where the game takes place. The game proper starts with a cut scene that shows you on a plane, about to parachute out. There’s no character creation here, although once you get a little further into the game, you’ll be able to pick your clothes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/P3rXmBBI1GdQfgi0vVT9xKcFw90=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-2-db5990d1f64341eaae79e22a71bb8f95.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship"><a href="#Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship"></a><strong>Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship</strong></h2><p> The initial cutscene starts with you on a plane, preparing to jump. Your name is Kyle Crane, and you’re an undercover operative. You’ll parachute to the earth while your boss explains your mission―to find a stolen file―but the second you hit the ground, things don’t go as planned. You’re attacked and forced to fire your weapon to scatter your attackers. Of course, in zombie-infested Harran, a gunshot is zombie bait. Suddenly they’re swarming toward you and things look very dire, until you’re rescued by a pair of strangers, a man and a woman. The man dies saving you but you and the woman escape. Her name is Jade, and she’ll play a big role throughout the story as you try to win her and her brother’s trust.</p><p>Harran is a whole different city at night.</p><p> You’re a spy sent in to infiltrate this group of survivors by the Global Relief Effort or GRE, but now that they’ve saved your life, you start to feel like you owe them. They’ll send you on missions to prove yourself, such as setting up traps for air raid supply drops or battling the hostile bandits that prowl Harran’s streets. Throughout the game, you balance accomplishing the GRE’s task with serving the best interest of this group of survivors you find yourself increasingly attached to.</p><p> This is a fairly linear game with regards to the plot. There’s a main storyline for you to follow, with some optional side quests that you can take or leave. The narrative does a decent job of building up the circumstances for Kyle feeling torn between his mission and these people, and you’ll learn more about the virus as you go, as well as Antizin, the fictional drug that could lead to a cure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8G35q3VsoSEuht_3bqsGm0Pwz-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-7-d9d2bbe8881e476f8dfb3c13059634ed.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111967/7443" target="_top" id="2111967">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111967" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111967/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore"><a href="#Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore"></a><strong>Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore</strong></h2><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour. Other zombie games focus on having slow zombies you can run away from, or dumb zombies you sneak past, but Dying Light takes a completely different approach. Instead, the basic zombies are fast and almost always know where you are―but they can’t climb or jump. This means you can stay safe by leaping between rooftops, running up ramps, balancing across bars, etc. The parkour feature is the biggest thing that makes Dying Light unique in an oversaturated genre, and also part of what makes the game so much fun. It’s entertaining to cross the city running as fast as you can without pausing, challenging yourself to get from point A to point B without ever touching the ground.</p><p> If you do happen to find yourself on the ground with a few zombies around you, you’ll have a variety of weapons you can smash a zombies head in with. The game focuses mainly on melee, with occasional firefights with other bandits. The melee weapon system has an upgrade system that involves fusing together found materials. The melee combat is solid, and your swings connect in a satisfying way.</p><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour.</p><p> There are quite a few different types of zombies, and more are introduced the longer you play. There are runners who can parkour right along beside you, frog-men zombies that spit acid, and hulking beasts that swing giant sledgehammers. It’s this variety that keeps the gameplay fun―until night falls.</p><p> Harran is a whole different city at night. If you aren’t in a safe zone, you’ll quickly learn that running through the city at night is terrifying, specifically because of a zombie type called volatiles. Volatiles are crazy strong, super-fast, and will chase after you relentlessly until you get out of sight―not an easy thing to do when you’re freaking out. It can be a real rush to try to do a mission at night, so if things aren’t feeling tense enough for you, just wait until the sunsets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YctEePpYKsIXQ5kU-hQ8w7o9CDo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-4-1edeaf05c6ba435e9b81e68a13831ac6.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135404/19272" target="_top" id="2135404">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135404" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135404/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> The graphics of Dying Light compare well to other triple-A titles, though it feels like the developers took more care with the scenery than the characters. Human models look a little plasticky, but the world around you is textured beautifully and rich with small details like posters and graffiti that help make the world around you feel real.</p><p> Character animation is also excellent, and the buildings and other objects within the world offer a variety of ways to jump, climb, and crawl. The open urban landscape of Harran allows players to decide how they want to explore, acquire materials, and fight. You’ll be able to come at certain locations from a variety of angles,and it’s this sense of freedom and attention to the environments that brings Dying Light together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sy9NHLj8JNe2eaeS9HJJdejt6QE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-6-56ef808272b544e6a1038f4a5d0280f1.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend"></a><strong>Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend</strong></h2><p> On PlayStation 4, you can purchase the game for $14, a fantastic value. You’ll get more than enough gameplay and fun to justify a purchase at that low cost. However, if you want to play on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll have to either wait for the game to go on sale, or you’ll have to pay $40. Considering the game is older now, we’d suggest getting the game on sale (it goes on sale often through Steam). There’s a lot of fun to be had in Dying Light, especially if you have a friend to play with, so if you’re thinking about getting the game, we’d say go for it.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other zombie and parkour games"></a><strong>Competition: Other zombie and parkour games</strong></h2><p> There are a lot of other zombie survival games out there, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’d recommend them if you liked Dying Light. You might consider Days Gone, another PlayStation 4 zombie apocalypse game set in an open world, but if the parkour was the main attraction, you might look into the game Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. The game follows a girl in a sci-fi world and features first-person parkour running and fighting. Instead of the rough and gritty world of Dying Light, Catalyst takes place in a sleek futuristic dystopia that’s all glossy chrome and burnished glass.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An original in the zombie survival genre.</strong></p><p> Dying Light is a game that took an overdone trope and used it to create a fresh game. Its fun parkour and co-op gameplay make for a great gaming experience, particularly when shared with friends. The variety of zombie enemies combined with the excellent melee combat keep the experience fresh even in the late game―and if things feel too simple, doing a mission at night is a wholly different experience from daylight outings. Dying Light is a great game in the zombie survival genre that we would recommend to most players.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Dying Light</li><li>Price  $14.00</li><li>Available Platforms  PC (Steam) Playstation 4 Xbox One OS X Linux</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/can-asus-ac88u-live-up-to-its-promises-in-a-real-world-test-game-on/"><u>Can Asus AC88U Live Up To Its Promises In A Real World Test - Game On</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/effective-solutions-for-resolving-call-of-duty-warzone-black-screen-issue/"><u>Effective Solutions for Resolving Call of Duty: Warzone Black Screen Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/exclusive-oculus-quest-2-elite-gaming-headset-accessory-kit-with-durable-carry-pouch-in-depth-analysis-and-user-guide/"><u>Exclusive Oculus Quest 2 Elite Gaming Headset Accessory Kit with Durable Carry Pouch – In-Depth Analysis & User Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-perfect-guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-on-vivo-v30-lite-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, A Perfect Guide To Remove or Disable Google Smart Lock On Vivo V30 Lite 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-fitbit-charge-4-a-perfect-blend-of-design-and-functionality/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Fitbit Charge 4 - A Perfect Blend of Design & Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/instagram-vids-to-mp3s-a-noobs-guide-revealed-for-2024/"><u>Instagram Vids to MP3s - A Noob's Guide Revealed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-saying-hello-in-spanish-dive-into-these-top-10-phrases/"><u>Mastering the Art of Saying 'Hello' In Spanish - Dive Into These Top 10 Phrases</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/navigating-through-premium-wrist-support-gadgets-for-typists-the-2024-edition/"><u>Navigating Through Premium Wrist Support Gadgets for Typists - The 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleash-your-creativity-top-20-free-adobe-premiere-title-templates/"><u>New In 2024, Unleash Your Creativity Top 20 Free Adobe Premiere Title Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/revolutionizing-reception-unveiling-the-remarkable-qualities-of-the-clearstream-eclipse-antenna/"><u>Revolutionizing Reception: Unveiling the Remarkable Qualities of the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tutorial-installing-android-debug-bridge-adb-on-a-windows-machine/"><u>Step-by-Step Tutorial: Installing Android Debug Bridge (Adb) on a Windows Machine</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-elite-selection-of-17-inch-laptops-to-buy/"><u>The Elite Selection of 17-Inch Laptops to Buy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-moto-gs-enhanced-user-experience-robust-performance-reasonable-battery-span-and-digital-pen/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Moto G's Enhanced User Experience: Robust Performance, Reasonable Battery Span & Digital Pen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-alternatives.techidaily.com/unlocking-efficiency-with-innovation-how-abbyy-is-revolutionizing-business-through-its-process-digital-twin/"><u>Unlocking Efficiency with Innovation: How ABBYY Is Revolutionizing Business Through Its Process Digital Twin</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-web.techidaily.com/iuodleocqeodqplusocuoodoplusodvoocuuoduplusodnoodquodpeodvoodooobjoapnplusidveoblplusobpuobhoobquobhowgtowqioobruinoplusaxuuetljrjg4fjgqpjgrnjgqkv67lvqnjgqz240/"><u>フォルジャーズ・ボリュームが機能していない場合の解決策:ディスク修復ガイダンス</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses roughly the same design as many of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, and it didn’t give the absolute best results either. Nonetheless, it’s still going to be the best choice for a really large segment of buyers out there simply because of how aggressively its priced.</p><p> If you are living inside of a large metropolitan area, you likely don’t need the best possible antenna to pick up the channels being broadcast to you over the air. Furthermore, I didn’t see that big of a difference in performance as price increased. Unless you step it all the way up to a much larger, much more expensive solution, the difference in performance is probably not worth it, which is why the 1byone is an easy recommendation. Let’s see how it performed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FEdsHVNn7IxwxXsSkRT0jxmmRuQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_02-d797d473ec154becbab8a3023cff8b53.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834903">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834903">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834903%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834903/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1160850">                    <video width="576" height="324" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1160850">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1160850%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1160850/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Vanilla"><a href="#Design-Vanilla" class="headerlink" title="Design: Vanilla"></a><strong>Design: Vanilla</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses a flat rectangular design similar to other powered indoor antennas on the market. The 13.25 x 9.25 inch antenna surface is roughly in line with most of the other products I looked at in this category, the only real difference being that the 1byone has a much more rigid surface.</p><p> Being a powered antenna, the 1byone uses an external amplifier to boost the signal. This box contains a coaxial input attached via the included 16.5ft cable, and has a power input, which can be supplied by the TV itself if it can support USB power. Otherwise, 1byone includes a USB power adapter.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fairly-intuitive"><a href="#Setup-Fairly-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fairly intuitive"></a><strong>Setup: Fairly intuitive</strong></h2><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas. Simply attach the 16.5ft coaxial cable to the external amplifier, connect the power to a USB power source, and then attach the coaxial cable from the amplifier to your TV.</p><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Performance-Good-enough-for-most"><a href="#Performance-Good-enough-for-most" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Good enough for most"></a><strong>Performance: Good enough for most</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna didn’t have the best performance of the antennas we’ve tested, falling somewhere in the middle of the pack. In my channel acquisition test, I averaged 59 channels across all the tests performed. This compares to the worst performing antenna at just 47, and the best at 76.</p><p> This should be more than suitable for most people living within a city in relatively close proximity to the source of the TV signal. As for those living further, your mileage may vary.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134497/18498" target="_top" id="2134497">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134497" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134497/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Middle-of-the-road"><a href="#Range-Middle-of-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Range: Middle of the road"></a><strong>Range: Middle of the road</strong></h2><p> 1byone makes no specific promises about the range of their antenna, although they do cite users having positive experiences from as far as 48 miles away in their customer testimonials. Given how many factors impact the effective range, I think it is somewhat wise not to make any promises. Nonetheless, this is clearly a device that will be best suited for people living in or near major metropolitan areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6y-ITpY8n7xf8BteMqdJjYm-paU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_05-178a02351af040cc89c86169b88a6de2.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036501/19272" target="_top" id="2036501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036501/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-A-great-deal"><a href="#Price-A-great-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great deal"></a><strong>Price: A great deal</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna costs just $25, making it the least expensive option out of the antennas I tested. It picked up all the major channels that I would actually watch, and didn’t have any issues with the signal. So from my perspective, why would I pay more? I think buyers would probably be best served by seeing if an antenna like this works for them. If you discover you need something more substantial, feel free to move on to a pricier option.</p><h2 id="1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna"><a href="#1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna"></a><strong>1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Another popular manufacturer is Mohu, and the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna offers a simpler, non-amplified solution that only loses out on a hair of performance versus the 1byone.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> You can tell Microsoft put a considerable amount of thought into the Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard’s design. From the manta ray style folds, which keep shoulders and hands at a relaxed, comfortable angle, to the detached numpad and magnetized risers for increased customization options when you want them, the Sculpt is quite the package. As with anything new, it took a period of adjustment, but we found it relatively quick thanks to the intuitive, easy-to-use design.</p><h2 id="Design-Made-for-comfort"><a href="#Design-Made-for-comfort" class="headerlink" title="Design: Made for comfort"></a><strong>Design: Made for comfort</strong></h2><p> The Sculpt is an ergonomic keyboard with a split design akin to that of a manta ray. The two halves of the keyboard sweep outwards and downwards creating an empty, raised space in the center of its swoop design. Its keys vary in size, with those nearest to the split being slightly wider than those on the outer edges of the keyboard. It’s largely made with plastic and has a bit of a clacky sound as you type. The Sculpt employs a standard layout with a fabric wrist pad at the front for extra comfort. This intuitive, split design combined with the wrist pad help your wrists, hands, and shoulders sit at a neutral, natural angle in order to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >alleviate repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that frequent typists are prone to over time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Cgdvz2K5QV0PheSGAjQNXTdhKP4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_02-e457e23b0c0848dbaad1197549efcc47.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> One unique feature of the Sculpt we loved was the function switch. Located on the upper-right hand side of the keyboard, this switch allows you to toggle the functionality of the top row keys, replacing the function key. Options include refreshing the active page, navigating to the home page in web, opening up the computer’s settings, a play&#x2F;pause button, switching between active windows, and increasing or decreasing volume.</p><p> Located on the upper-right hand side of the keyboard, this switch allows you to toggle the functionality of the top row keys, replacing the function key.</p><p> Often, keyboards include a next track or previous track multimedia feature, which the Sculpt was decidedly lacking. This was a disappointment, but otherwise, the functions are good inclusions and easy to use. If this extra functionality isn’t your thing, you simply flip this switch to the gray position and these F1-F12 keys retain their standard functionality.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Batteries-required"><a href="#Setup-Process-Batteries-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Batteries required"></a><strong>Setup Process: Batteries required</strong></h2><p> The Microsoft Sculpt arrives in a box with the Sculpt itself, a detached numpad, a setup guide, a registration number, and a product guide. Microsoft provides a magnetic riser that can attach to the bottom of the wrist pad as an additional setup option. It also includes a warning packet on lithium batteries since the detached numpad is powered by a 3V lithium CR2430 battery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MTaN1qUX3urJwcwQ_tv5g532Af4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_03-ec82ba429b58431eabefb1f147f474b9.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> Setting the Microsoft Sculpt up is simple. Simply lift the lid off of the battery compartment on the backside of the unit and remove the slip of paper that separates the two AAA batteries. Then, take the provided dongle from the compartment and attach it to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your PC. If you’re planning on using the detached numpad, don’t forget to also remove the slip of paper from its backside to active it. Then the Sculpt is ready for use.</p><h2 id="Battery-and-Features-Backlighting-missing-and-just-one-dongle-to-rule-them-all"><a href="#Battery-and-Features-Backlighting-missing-and-just-one-dongle-to-rule-them-all" class="headerlink" title="Battery and Features: Backlighting missing, and just one dongle to rule them all"></a><strong>Battery and Features: Backlighting missing, and just one dongle to rule them all</strong></h2><p> Backlighting—we love it, but the Sculpt doesn’t have it. This is, in large part, thanks to its battery-powered design. It wouldn’t make a great deal of sense for the Sculpt to have backlighting since the two AAA<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-aa-and-aaa-rechargeable-batteries-4134295" >alkaline batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would drain significantly faster, but we sure did miss it. It’s important to note that our love of backlighting is also a matter of personal preference. If it’s important to you, you might want to consider a different model. If you can live without it, the Sculpt still has a lot to offer.</p><p> Encrypted keystrokes, wireless technology, a detached numpad, a magnetic riser, and an ergonomic design make this keyboard a surefire winner.</p><p> One major drawback to the Sculpt’s design is the dongle that associates the keyboard to your PC is one of a kind. This is thanks to the AES 128-bit encryption technology the Sculpt uses to keep your keystrokes safe. Associated to the keyboard at the factory, there simply is no replacing it if it’s lost. While the Sculpt isn’t really travel-friendly due to its size, it would do best in an environment where it’s set up once and stays put so as to prevent losing this important piece of tech.</p><h2 id="Price-Great-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Great-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for the features"></a><strong>Price: Great for the features</strong></h2><p> Ergonomic keyboards tend to cost anywhere from $50-$200. Generally retailing for around $90 on Amazon or $129.95 MSRP, the Sculpt sits in the middle. Its features are nice for the price, too. Encrypted keystrokes, wireless technology, a detached numpad, a magnetic riser, and an ergonomic design with a wrist pad for extra comfort makes this keyboard surefire winner in our books.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BarmRhIEQlGkF0UEDLP9peOh3co=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_05-646724c396184c12836f3f2ce2ced675.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087248/19272" target="_top" id="2087248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087248/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> The Sculpt’s main competition is the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard. It’s a split-style ergonomic keyboard that connects wirelessly to a PC. Instead of using plastic materials, the Surface has a higher quality build that is not only more comfortable but slightly more sound-absorbent as well. And, better yet, the Surface uses the fan-favorite Alcantara fabric, an Italian material with a suede-like feel to it, as part of its wrist pad which makes it incredibly comfortable. Its numpad is attached, however, and it doesn’t include a magnetic riser. If you prefer your wrist sitting at a raised, more neutral angle, or if you like the idea of a detached numpad, the Sculpt is the clear winner here.</p><p> One major drawback to the Sculpt’s design is the dongle that associates the keyboard to your PC is one of a kind.</p><p> Another major difference between them is the Surface doesn’t have a unique dongle associated with it at the factory.

The Surface tends to retail for around $129, much more than the Sculpt which retails for around $80. That said, it’s an upgrade in almost every way. If you’re on a budget, the Sculpt is a great option, but if you’re able to splurge, the Surface is our top pick for wireless ergonomic keyboards.</p><p> Check out our other reviews of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >best ergonomic keyboards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> available on the market today.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A secure, mid-priced wireless keyboard with lots of customization options.</strong></p><p> The Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard is a great mid-priced wireless keyboard with multiple customization options thanks to its detached numpad and magnetic riser. Combined with its AES 128-bit encryption technology, comfortable wrist pad, and handy function switch, it’s a great investment for the price. The intuitive, natural angles it creates will have your hands thanking you later.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>Price  $80.95</li><li>Weight  2 lbs.</li><li>Model Number  5KV-00001</li><li>Keyboard Dimensions  15.4 x 8.96 x 2.5 in.</li><li>Numpad Dimensions  5.2 x 3.65 x 1.0 in.</li><li>Encryption  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-bit Encryption</li><li>Keyboard Battery  2 AAA alkaline batteries and a 3V Lithium CR2430 battery</li><li>Numpad Battery  3V lithium CR2430 battery</li><li>Compatibility  Windows, Mac 10.7 and higher, Android 3.2 and higher</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-elevate-your-content-game-with-these-powerful-youtube-shortcuts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Elevate Your Content Game with These Powerful YouTube Shortcuts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-choose-best-free-youtube-video-editor-apps-on-ios/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How to Choose Best-Free YouTube Video Editor Apps on iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-ushering-bliss-into-your-unboxing-experience/"><u>[Updated] Ushering Bliss Into Your Unboxing Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-alternatives.techidaily.com/1-best-online-hd-camera-softwares-discover-manycams-features/"><u>1.

Once you pay the upfront cost for the antenna you’re not stuck with any monthly fees for your local channels.

The picture quality is comparable to what you’d get from the cable company or streaming service—or it’s supposed to be. I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528693/16446" target="_top" id="1528693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528693/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)</strong></h2><p> So many things<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >affect an antenna’s performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —location, household electronics, tree cover, tower location, and more. The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13. In new condition, it sells for $20, which is still a great deal. However, you can find other affordable antennas for between $20 and $50 that provide a much longer range, and many offer additional features, like a longer cable. With the AmazonBasics model, you can return the unit within 30 days if it doesn’t work in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MN6DSsu9Myyo6CdrSW5MJTjHoug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-4-fd9968307cb44c9d9e824750413e0028.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135367/19272" target="_top" id="2135367">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135367" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135367/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna"><a href="#AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna"></a><strong>AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/ANTOP-Omni-Directional-Indoor-HD-UHF-VHF-TV-Antenna/1000503257" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a 40-mile range antenna that sells for around $35. It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141683/17092" target="_top" id="2141683">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141683" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141683/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Ultra-Thin Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  AmazonBasics</li><li>SKU  DVB-T9088</li><li>Price  $20.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.09 x 13.31 x 0.075 in.</li><li>Warranty  30 day return policy, One year limited warranty</li><li>Resolution  1080p</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Frequency  174-230 MHz</li><li>Receiving range  VHF&#x2F;UHF</li><li>Atenna version  Passive</li><li>Ports  Coax</li><li>Cable length  10-foot Coax Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-cure-for-disconnected-channels-in-obs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Cure for Disconnected Channels in OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/implicity-in-code-constructing-a-streamlined-youtube-sign-up/"><u>[New] Simplicity in Code Constructing a Streamlined YouTube Sign-Up</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-spectacular-20-anime-openers-hits/"><u>[New] Spectacular 20 Anime Openers' Hits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-pandemonium-playlist-10-wildest-tiktok-gaming-adventures-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Pandemonium Playlist 10 Wildest TikTok Gaming Adventures for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/couper-un-dvd-avec-des-sous-titres-ou-ajouter-des-sous-titres-imposes-guide-complet/"><u>Couper Un DVD Avec Des Sous-Titres Ou Ajouter Des Sous-Titres Imposés : Guide Complet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-unbeatable-deals-on-fossil-a-comprehensive-review-guide/"><u>Discover Unbeatable Deals on Fossil: A Comprehensive Review Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/go-next-gen-move-your-computer-from-windows-8-to-windows-11/"><u>Go Next Gen: Move Your Computer From Windows 8 to Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/how-does-the-nintendo-switch-lite-compare-a-cost-effective-handheld-option-reviewed/"><u>How Does the Nintendo Switch Lite Compare?

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044583/7443" target="_top" id="2044583">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044583" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044583/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134246/18498" target="_top" id="2134246">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134246" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134246/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148634/16836" target="_top" id="2148634">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148634" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="80" height="31"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148634/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C302 Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  TopMate</li><li>MPN  C302</li><li>Price  $30.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2016</li><li>Weight  1.09 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.2 x 10.43 x 1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Ports  USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-avatar-architecture-your-uncomplicated-guide-to-virtual-existence/"><u>[New] Avatar Architecture Your Uncomplicated Guide to Virtual Existence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-direct-streams-from-obs-to-insta-profile/"><u>[Updated] Direct Streams From OBS to Insta Profile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-explore-best-iphone-selfie-boosters-all-free-and-upgraded-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Explore Best iPhone Selfie Boosters - All Free and Upgraded for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-ideal-screen-re-recorders-for-youtube-performances-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ideal Screen Re-Recorders for YouTube Performances for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-final-cut-pros-top-effect-enhancers-the-essential-10/"><u>2024 Approved Final Cut Pro's Top Effect Enhancers The Essential 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamlabs-competitors-in-the-livestream-arena/"><u>2024 Approved Streamlabs' Competitors in the Livestream Arena</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/breakdown-of-the-fitbit-charge/"><u>Breakdown of the Fitbit Charge</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/exploring-the-sonic-depths-of-creative-labs-2013-powerhouse-the-sound-blaster-zxr-reviewed/"><u>Exploring the Sonic Depths of Creative Lab's 2013 Powerhouse - The Sound Blaster ZxR Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/green-thumbs-united-top-10-farm-titles-for-friendly-playtime/"><u>Green Thumbs United Top 10 Farm Titles for Friendly Playtime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-detailed-review-of-doctorsim-unlock-service-for-iphone-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Detailed Review of doctorSIM Unlock Service For iPhone 14 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/maisto-rc-rock-crawler-a-detailed-look-at-your-next-quality-family-rc-car-purchase/"><u>Maisto RC Rock Crawler: A Detailed Look at Your Next Quality Family R/C Car Purchase</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/top-non-microsoft-suite-software-picks/"><u>Top Non-Microsoft Suite Software Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-next-console-leader-ps5-vs-ps4-pro/"><u>Unveiling the Next Console Leader: PS5 Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re considering leveling up to a wristwatch that can do more than tell time, but want the look and feel of a typical watch, you may be interested in a hybrid smartwatch. The Withings Move falls right into this group of devices that have more capability than a regular watch and still look like a classic timepiece. It offers fitness tracking but doesn’t require you to be plugged in at all times like most smartwatches.</p><p> We tested the Withings Move to see how comfortable it is for everyday use and explore the extent of its smartwatch characteristics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SRCqvDOet8fouJ8uY8ze0LlCiog=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-2-1fdc9f06eb6a45f2baa2b840822fba5d.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144282/7443" target="_top" id="2144282">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144282" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144282/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Slim-and-clean"><a href="#Design-Slim-and-clean" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slim and clean"></a><strong>Design: Slim and clean</strong></h2><p> We don’t typically think of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as being nearly weightless, but the Withings Move is just that. Weighing in at just a little over one ounce, this watch is almost undetectable on the wrist.</p><p> That’s because there’s nothing really heavy in the construction of the device. The back of the face is made of stainless steel, but the case protecting the face is plastic. The lack of weight is nice, but the plastic coupled with the somewhat-flimsy silicone band gives the watch a less refined feel. An added boost to the slim profile is the water-resistance of up to 50 meters, but that seems like a contradiction given the lack of ruggedness in the design.</p><p> Weighing in at just a little over one ounce, this watch is almost undetectable on the wrist.</p><p> At first glance, it looks like your average sporty analog watch. But it’s easy to spot the hint that this device has more functionality. In addition to the usual time and second hands, the Withings Move also features a smaller subdial. This section is labeled from 0-100, and this is where your step goal progress is measured (by percent of completion).</p><p> As far as buttons go, there’s only one, and it’s in the usual spot on the right side of the watch face. It’s not used for winding, though. This is the button you’ll rely on for shutting off the alarm function and starting&#x2F;stopping a workout session.</p><p> Depending on the category you fall into, the lack of a touchscreen could be the largest benefit or drawback of the design. Users who want the look of a regular analog watch will be pleased by the lack of a typical smartwatch screen on their wrist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Qz1dlsE8jl99mXc7-kQ5LCVoiK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-3-b1e97631284d40829bd5714c59dc5f2a.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-As-easy-as-1-2-3"><a href="#Setup-Process-As-easy-as-1-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :As easy as 1-2-3"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>As easy as 1-2-3</strong></h2><p> Given such a simple and clean design, it’s natural to expect the setup process to be the same. We found that to be the case.</p><p> The Withings Move comes with no chargers, cables, or ports of any kind, so there’s no charging required out of the box. All the work is done through the complementary Health Mate app, which we downloaded from the App Store.</p><p> The first thing we had to do was sign up for an account in order to move forward with the installation. After we did that, most of the steps took just a few seconds or up to a minute at the longest.</p><p> First, we paired the Withings Move with our phone via Bluetooth, which was instantaneous. Next, we provided profile information for better activity metrics, downloaded an update, made sure the watch dials were working and the time was set correctly, and we were good to go.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Light-as-a-feather-even-while-sleeping"><a href="#Comfort-Light-as-a-feather-even-while-sleeping" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Light as a feather, even while sleeping"></a><strong>Comfort: Light as a feather, even while sleeping</strong></h2><p> Some watches can feel heavy by the end of the day, but we didn’t encounter that weighed-down feeling with the Withings Move. The watch is really lightweight and the band is soft, flexible, and slim, which made sleeping with it a non-issue. It was also easy to achieve a good fit—especially for smaller wrists—thanks to the plentiful notches and the tab to keep the band in place.</p><p> The Withings Move is not a flashy device with lots of buttons. The button on the side is only used to silence the alarm you set through the app or to initiate an activity session. Because of the comfort and the sleek look, it’s definitely versatile enough to wear on a daily basis. It doesn’t scream “sport watch,” but it’s also not overly decorative, offering an appealing mid-way point between sporty and dressy.</p><p> We did notice that both the front and back of the watch face scratched easily over the course of a week, and suspect this could be a bigger issue for those who are harder on their accessories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WIXFA6BpXvAMWLdKpJ_jmzZh6o4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-5-cbc0f43d847b453bbfae994f03374cdb.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082530/7443" target="_top" id="2082530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Limited-activity-tracking"><a href="#Performance-Limited-activity-tracking" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Limited activity tracking"></a><strong>Performance: Limited activity tracking</strong></h2><p> While hybrid smartwatches like the Withings Move offer ease of use and versatility with your wardrobe and daily wear, they’re limited when it comes to tracking performance. Some activities are automatically recorded: walking, running, hiking, and swimming. With outdoor exercising, you can also track distance and elevation with the connected GPS feature.</p><p> There’s also support for all kinds of other general fitness activities like indoor cycling, weight training, and pilates. All you have to do to log these exercises is to wear the device and launch a workout session by holding the button on the watch for a second or two until it vibrates. That’s the same action for stopping the workout, too.</p><p> It offers fitness tracking but doesn’t require you to be plugged in at all times like most smartwatches.</p><p> Most activities allow you to track your speed, activity length and type, steps taken, and calories burned. You won’t be able to monitor active heart rate for any activity, though. And swimming is even more limited: you can only track how long you’ve swum and the calories exerted. The big bottom line to remember, however, is for any distance-based activity you want to log, you’ll need your smartphone.</p><p> We took the Withings Move (and our smartphone) on a run and a walk, and just like it says it will, the watch automatically detected our activity. When we compared it with our usual step trackers, a Garmin 35 and the iHealth app, steps were comparable. For running activity, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the pace was pretty much spot on. But we missed having information about overall pace, cadence, active heart rate, and distance indicators on the watch face itself.</p><p> We also tested the water-resistance while washing dishes and in the shower. The Withings Move is water-resistant up to 50 meters, which, according to the manufacturer, makes it acceptable for lap swimming, splashing, and dishwashing. Even though we didn’t put it to the depth test, it held up to submersion in soapy water and never missed a beat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vaUmI1isQP98tmL8uIZSghmAWGs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-6-259d8034cfb64485be60f9c5754fec79.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Long-lasting-and-hassle-free"><a href="#Battery-Long-lasting-and-hassle-free" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Long-lasting and hassle-free"></a><strong>Battery: Long-lasting and hassle-free</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move is reported to have a battery life of up to 18 months, and we really enjoyed that aspect over the week we tested it. Unlike typical smartwatches, we didn’t have to worry about draining the battery and recharging. The internal battery is a typical replaceable watch battery, and the user guide offers directions for removal and replacement when the time comes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/02bkMrpkzqBOue1ffhHNfQqaIuk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-4-df866fafd70a44c592e0e06e0ea53ae7.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484940/16446" target="_top" id="1484940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484940/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-An-emphasis-on-general-wellness"><a href="#Software-An-emphasis-on-general-wellness" class="headerlink" title="Software: An emphasis on general wellness"></a><strong>Software: An emphasis on general wellness</strong></h2><p> Though activity data is somewhat limited, the Withings Move does offer some other more in-depth insights. Sleep activity, for example, is automatically detected and doesn’t require any other action besides wearing the watch while sleeping. When you wake in the morning, you’ll be able to view your quality of sleep for the previous night based on the number of interruptions, duration, and even depth of sleep. There is a hiccup with this feature, though—we noticed when we took it off at our desk one morning, it seemed to think we had fallen back asleep and continued reading our sleep quality.</p><p> Another tracking perk is the resting heart rate measuring feature. This requires that you give the Health Mate app permission to access your phone camera, but if you do this, simply placing your finger in front of your camera lens enables the app to sense your pulse and turn out a resting heart rate reading. The reading could be quite slow if we didn’t remain entirely still, which is almost impossible to achieve completely.</p><p> But that quirk aside, the heart rate feature is an appealing addition to a device that offers few flourishes. It obviously does require your smartphone, but all activity (which can also be viewed on the web through your Withings account) is closely tethered to your device.</p><p> Despite the lack of a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-touchscreen-4144770" >touchscreen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or dashboard interface on the watch, it was never difficult to sync data with the Health Mate app or view metrics. It’s easy and uncomplicated to use for recording or launching activities—including<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-food-tracker-apps-4172287" >tracking food <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the MyFitnessPal integration. Since the app is really what provides the “smart” qualities of the device, we hoped it would deliver on that, and it did.</p><p> There are also a number of other supplemental programs you can sign up for through the Health Connect app in order to up your general wellness. Most of these programs, which are free to join, require a specific type of Withings device, but others, like a meditation and pregnancy tracking program, don’t need any additional equipment.</p><h2 id="Price-A-bargain-for-the-value"><a href="#Price-A-bargain-for-the-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bargain for the value"></a><strong>Price: A bargain for the value</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move retails for $69.95, which is an attractive and affordable price for a hybrid smartwatch—most competitors tend to be well above $100. While these other models, like the Fossil Harper and Fossil Q Commuter, typically come with more functionality like music storage or streaming, notifications, or taking a picture from your phone, there’s also a bigger price associated with those features.</p><p> Those looking for a dressier and more substantial watch may find these Fossil models to be better alternatives. Other devices that are comparable in price, like the Fitbit Inspire Fitness Tracker, lack the analog watch qualities and look like designated activity trackers. The Withings Move splits the difference at a modest price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484951/16446" target="_top" id="1484951">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484951" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484951/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Withings-Move-vs-Misfit-Phase"><a href="#Withings-Move-vs-Misfit-Phase" class="headerlink" title="Withings Move vs. Misfit Phase"></a><strong>Withings Move vs. Misfit Phase</strong></h2><p> The Misfit Phase is another hybrid smartwatch with a classic wristwatch look, maybe even more so than the Withings Move. Priced at around $175, the Misfit Phase is more expensive, but also comes with a few bonuses that the Withings Move lacks, like text notifications, playing and pausing music on your phone, and also taking selfies.</p><p> On the other hand, the Misfit Phase’s battery life is less impressive (up to six months) and it’s considerably heavier at nearly seven ounces. It also lacks the subdial feature. If you want more impressive looks and some flashier details, you may be happier paying extra for the Misfit Phase. But if you’re a fan of less equipment on your wrist, the Withings Move could satisfy your hybrid smartwatch wishes.</p><p> Are you interested in weighing other hybrid and smartwatch options? Take a look at our roundup of the best smartwatches for women and the best cheap smartwatches.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Best for those who prefer the analog experience.</strong></p><p> The Withings Move is a strong entry-level fitness tracker for the person who wants to track activities without going all-in on a smartwatch. It’s inexpensive, sporty, and subtle, which makes it compelling for those who don’t want to be distracted by notifications and all the hands-on features smartwatches bring to the table.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Withings Move Hybrid Smartwatch</li><li>Product Brand  Withings</li><li>Price  $69.99</li><li>Weight  1.12 oz.</li><li>Battery Capacity  18 months</li><li>Compatibility  iOS 10+, Android 6+</li><li>Waterproof  Yes, up to 50 meters</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth</li><li>Warranty  2 years</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/0-power-players-youtubes-ladies-in-gaming/"><u>[New] 10 Power Players YouTube's Ladies in Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-how-to-delete-comments-from-youtube-with-minimal-hassle-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Delete Comments From YouTube with Minimal Hassle for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-design-channels-get-free-visuals-now/"><u>2024 Approved Design Channels - Get Free Visuals Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovative-downloaders-unveiled-top-8-of-2023/"><u>2024 Approved Innovative Downloaders Unveiled Top 8 of 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/a-deep-dive-the-advanced-features-in-obs-recording-for-2024/"><u>A Deep Dive The Advanced Features in OBS Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/awaken-refreshed-with-ihome-zenergy-expert-review-of-the-innovative-sleep-therapy-gadget/"><u>Awaken Refreshed with IHome Zenergy: Expert Review of the Innovative Sleep Therapy Gadget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/drone-mastery-unleashed-why-the-dji-mavic-2-pro-stands-out-as-the-preferred-choice-for-professionals/"><u>Drone Mastery Unleashed: Why the DJI Mavic 2 Pro Stands Out as the Preferred Choice for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/essential-considerations-when-choosing-a-secondhand-ipad-device/"><u>Essential Considerations When Choosing a Secondhand iPad Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-of-amazons-fire-hd/"><u>Expert Analysis of Amazon's Fire HD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-vivo-s17-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Vivo S17?

This small but mighty mesh system represents a way to get into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> without emptying your wallet.</p><p> The X20 is a good choice for users who need broad coverage, with three units handling homes of up to 5,800 square feet. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> AX1800 Wi-Fi 6 support offers a comfortable 1.8Mbps bandwidth, although this is only partially on par with some of the pricier alternatives in this list.</p><p> But more importantly, the Deco X20 lacks the dedicated backhaul channel on more advanced mesh Wi-Fi systems. This means it may not perform as well on busy and heavily congested home networks — those with a dozen or more devices gaming, video calling, and streaming in 4K—but it should be more than enough for the online needs of smaller families.</p><p> The Deco X20 is a breeze to set up, thanks to TP-Link’s aptly named Deco app, which can help even the most inexperienced home networking users get up and running within a few minutes. It also includes TP-Link’s new HomeCare security suite, powered by Trend Micro. It offers anti-malware features and parental controls to keep your home network safe against intruders and kids away from the internet’s darker corners. Each unit includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports to connect non-wireless devices, but sadly, there aren’t any USB ports for sharing external storage devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> HomeCare, WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX1800 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><h2 id="Best-Parental-Controls"><a href="#Best-Parental-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Best Parental Controls"></a>Best Parental Controls</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >Netgear Orbi Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/e0pqAK3I9BIPd_HjQl8z5DRaZ-I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netgear-orbi-whole-home-wi-fi-system-41457ad2356b431eb21ef92d6fc06f7e.jpg" >Netgear Orbi Whole Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >$225 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fast and reliable coverage</li><li>Easy to set up</li><li>Highly configurable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>USB ports don’t support shared storage</li></ul><p> Netgear’s Orbi strikes an almost perfect balance of performance, price, and features among mesh Wi-Fi systems. With only two units, Orbi can provide fast and stable Wi-Fi over an area of up to 5,000 square feet, and this range can be easily extended by adding additional units.</p><p> Netgear promises that Orbi can deliver at least 150Mbps anywhere in your home, which was more than evident in our testing. You’ll enjoy smooth online performance throughout your living space without worrying about buffering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830" >Netflix 4K UHD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> streams or stuttering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zoom-and-how-does-it-work-4800476" >Zoom calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Orbi accomplishes this by dedicating the fastest of its three Wi-Fi bands as a backhaul channel. Remember that in a mesh network, data to or from your device may pass from one access point to the following multiple times before it reaches your router and moves on to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924" >Internet Service Provider <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network. The backhaul channel provides dedicated bandwidth for this pass-through traffic, ensuring you’ll get the same excellent wireless performance whether your devices are closer to the central unit or one of the satellite units.</p><p> This also makes the collection of four Gigabit Ethernet ports found on each unit even more helpful, as you can plug in things like a TV and not see a drop in speed. Each also has a USB 2.0 port for sharing printers around your home.

The MX 12600 bundle includes three identical Wi-Fi 6 capable AX4200 mesh units (three times 4,200 is 12,600, see?) for less than most other systems charge for only two. This means solid and reliable performance for homes of up to 8,100 square feet at an affordable price.</p><p> You’ll designate one of these units as the primary router that hosts your broadband connection, then place the other two wherever you need the best and strongest coverage in your home. The Velop system also features a “dynamic” backhaul channel: The system intelligently decides which of the three Wi-Fi bands is best suited to move traffic between the mesh stations and which should be available for your Wi-Fi clients.</p><p> Each unit also includes four Gigabit Ethernet ports, letting you hardwire in non-Wi-Fi devices. And thanks to a high-speed USB 3.2 port on the back of each unit, you can connect multiple hard drives or other storage devices for sharing files or even streaming media.</p><p> Linksys’ mobile app also makes the system a cinch to set up, walking you through getting the first unit online and then joining the other two into a single mesh network. Although you’ll need to use the mobile app for the initial configuration, you can manage the system from the more familiar web interface once the mesh has been configured.</p><p> The MX12600 system offers all the basic networking features you’d expect from a modern router, including elementary Quality of Service (QoS) support (which prioritizes devices based on the type of service they’re using. There are rudimentary parental controls, but they should be enough for most typical users.

Since a two-unit system will give you 5,000 square feet of Wi-Fi coverage (which can be expanded by adding up to five more satellite units), you’ll be sure to see consistently fast speeds anywhere in your home.</p><p> Netgear has also packed in four Gigabit Ethernet ports on each station, so you’ll have plenty of room for wiring in devices like game consoles for maximum performance. The main router on this higher-end model also offers a high-speed 2.5Gbps<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wide-area-network-816383" >Wide Area Network (WAN) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port to ensure you’re ready for the fastest home broadband connections.</p><p> One disappointing aspect of Netgear’s newer Wi-Fi 6 solution is the omission of the USB ports found in earlier Orbi versions. The lack of advanced configuration settings may also let power users down compared to other Wi-Fi 6 routers. But if you want to maintain the best performance possible, even if it means sacrificing some network management features, this is the mesh system for you.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX6000 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cjLjOjMRWQJm5An87vAXSv1ZALw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetgearOrbiAX6000-01f5a284913b44099978b706c3a3fa79.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi AX6000"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/orbi-whole-home-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-review-5069596" >Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1444782">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1444782">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1444782%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1444782/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u36wLJKd2jTPAgvkVuGxo2A8P4g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/asus-zenwifi-xt8-ax6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-3865cd2d845349a78c533b0b397df43b.jpg" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 AX6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >$282 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/447452455" >$282 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1541979-REG/asus%5Fxt8%5Fb%5F2%5Fpk%5Fzenwifi%5Fac%5Fwhole%5Fhome%5Ftri%5Fband.html" >$350 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lots of advanced features</li><li>Parental and security controls</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Expensive</li></ul><p> Although Asus’ AiMesh technology will let you join almost any combination of Asus routers to form a mesh network, the company’s ZenWiFi XT8 takes that further.

The second generation of Google’s mesh solution, Nest Wi-Fi’s satellite units (called “point” units) double as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smart speakers. So, it’s an especially great choice for anyone already invested in the Google ecosystem. You can issue voice commands to control smart appliances, check the weather, send messages, and set up calendar appointments.</p><p> Three units—the central base station and two points—provide up to 5,400 square feet of coverage. Google’s Home and Wi-Fi apps make this an absolute cinch to set up and manage. It even lets you set up a guest network for your friends and other visitors and let them get online simply by<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >scanning a QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The main downside to Nest Wi-Fi is that the base station includes only one Ethernet LAN port, and you won’t find any at all on the satellite points, so you’ll need to add your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ethernet-and-network-hubs-816358" >network hub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to hardwire in some of your devices at the router. And if you need to wire in devices at the points, you’ll want to look elsewhere.</p><p> Additionally, the Nest doesn’t support the newer Wi-Fi 6 standard like some of the other systems here, so if you need maximum performance or are a stickler for future-proofing your network, the Nest may not be the best option.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC2200 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O_4HqL-cj7KOoa_JTrVN--P752o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleNestWi-Fi-9704c0e2a822442d89253e49f44d9948.jpg"                      alt="Google Nest Wi-Fi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137974/21526" target="_top" id="2137974">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137974" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137974/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-nest-wi-fi-review-4846243" >Google Nest Wi-Fi Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Design"><a href="#Best-Design" class="headerlink" title="Best Design"></a>Best Design</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >Linksys Velop AC6600 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/j4p01isOS24wSYnZhkkDN75cgIU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/linksys-velop-ac6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-system-c5531ec228e247eb88bb7d05247c3842.jpg" >Linksys Velop AC6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >$170 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/55384671" >$170 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcrichard.com/linksys-velop-whole-home-mesh-wi-fi-system-3-pack/WHW0303.html?slpfid=3" >View on Pcrichard.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Strong, consistent connection</li><li>Sleek Design</li><li>Great range</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some basic settings</li><li>Some features cost extra</li></ul><p> Linksys’ first whole home Wi-Fi system, the Velop Tri-Band AC6600, is one of the more attractive designs we’ve seen. Each sleek white node is roughly the size of a tower of Jenga blocks, and they look nice enough to sit on display rather than being hidden away. Linksys sells Velop nodes individually or in packs of two or three; each will give you about 2,000 square feet of coverage. So, a complete system can blanket a 6,000-square-foot home.</p><p> The Velop AC6600 system includes tri-band Wi-Fi and dedicates the second 5GHz band as a backhaul channel. This means it can keep traffic moving smoothly between all units for maximum performance throughout your home, even if one is under heavy usage. The downside is that your devices won’t be able to take advantage of the extra 5GHz band, so even though each of these AC2200 routers can theoretically provide 2,134Mbps of throughput, only 1,267Mbps of that total is available to your devices.</p><p> The Velop offers a simplified setup process thanks to the Linksys smartphone app. However, if you like to tinker with your network settings, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere since it has limited configuration options. There’s also no malware protection, and parental controls are confined to blocking websites and manually restricting internet access from specific devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA2 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC6600 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SkmNvOHzz4u2QHpClMEbMhzcBbQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LinksysVelopAC6600-2fd0f211926949cd9e38646f533fb981-6b8bc5f3009346dfaee7ef6b86357f34.jpg"                      alt="Linksys Velop AC6600"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/linksys-velop-review-powerful-mesh-router-5072402" >Linksys Velop Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network"></a>What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network</h2><p> Every wireless router, no matter how many antennas it has or how powerful it is, suffers from the same issue: radio signals weaken when they pass through walls, floors, and other obstructions. Mesh Wi-Fi network systems are designed to solve this problem by placing a number of nodes throughout your home or business, creating a uniformly strong signal with no dead spots.</p><p> Unlike traditional routers with wireless extenders and access points, mesh systems are designed from the ground up to work as a node-based system. Setting up a mesh Wi-Fi network system is typically a lot easier than connecting range extenders to an existing system, and they automatically pass your connection from one node to the next as you move around your home.</p><p> The main drawback of mesh Wi-Fi network systems is the price, as they tend to be more expensive than traditional routers. You can typically buy a nice router and some extenders for less than a mesh Wi-Fi starter kit, but if your situation really calls for a mesh system, it’s well worth the additional investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dFk9VbnycX8txbFO35hsBW2ZGvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4038590-2_1-5c8fbca346e0fb000172f07e.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139114/17108" target="_top" id="2139114">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139114" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139114/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528696/16446" target="_top" id="1528696">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528696" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528696/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use"><a href="#Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use" class="headerlink" title="Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?"></a>Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?</h3><p> Most mesh Wi-Fi network systems support a single<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-connected-home-817684" >smart home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> integration system, and a few support more than one.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the most commonly supported, with integration from manufacturers like Eero, Linksys, Netgear, and more.

You won’t find any routers that can be controlled via Siri, however, a few mesh systems are adding HomeKit-specific security features to keep your smart home devices protected from network intrusions, which is something that neither Google Home nor Amazon Alexa yet offers.</p><h3 id="Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs"><a href="#Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs"></a>Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs</h3><p> Since mesh systems are high-end equipment, they typically include robust security options and parental controls. There are a handful of systems that don’t include either, so look for those if you don’t have kids and prefer to manage security on individual devices.</p><p> The most important thing to check in this area is whether or not the security and parental controls of the mesh system you’re interested in require a subscription. Basic security options are often free, but the best-advanced protections and parental controls often come at the cost of an ongoing monthly subscription, so make sure to take that into account.  </p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What’s the difference between a mesh Wi-Fi system and a Wi-Fi extender?<br> Mesh Wi-Fi systems and Wi-Fi extenders extend the reach of your wireless signal beyond your main router’s range. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are more tightly integrated, with the main and satellite devices expressly designed to work in concert.</li><li>Are mesh Wi-Fi systems faster?<br> Technically speaking, a mesh Wi-Fi system won’t offer better performance than an equivalent standalone router when you’re sitting right beside it. Since speed always falls off due to a weaker signal as you move farther away from your router, mesh systems can make a difference in larger homes.</li><li>Do you need to replace your existing router?<br> In most cases, the answer is yes. Although some mesh Wi-Fi systems can work with existing routers, you’ll generally get better performance and a much better user experience if you use a full mesh Wi-Fi system. If you’re a cable internet subscriber, you’ll still need to hang onto your cable modem.</li><li>How fast is a mesh Wi-Fi system?<br> Since mesh Wi-Fi network systems are uniformly high-end, they are also pretty fast.

This smartwatch delivers fitness tracking, contactless payment, and more. Plus, The signature dual display layers an efficient light-reflective screen over a vibrant AMOLED is a marquee feature worth gawking over. It’s also practical for stretching battery life to the maximum 72-hour potential—and even longer in Essential Mode.</p><p> This Wear OS device is friendly to both iPhone and Android users, though it’s decidedly still more beneficial to the latter. Despite missing out on some key features best for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-android-smartphones-577403" >Android phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and generally feeling like this was just a bit too much watch for my wrist, I came away from a few days of use impressed by the battery life and solid workout tracking.</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-sporty-with-a-large-display"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-sporty-with-a-large-display" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and sporty with a large display"></a>Design: Sleek and sporty with a large display</h2><p> If you enjoy a prominent display, the TicWatch Pro 3 offers that in spades, with a unique 1.4-inch two-fold design. The top layer is an always-on, low-light display that’s usable in an extended battery-saving mode (Essential Mode). Underneath this efficient layer, you’ll find a bright 454 x 454 Retina AMOLED display that adjusts automatically based on the amount of available light. Mobvoi also offers an extensive library of watch faces on the device itself or through the companion apps.</p><p> The all-black build and face design gives this watch a sporty feel, extended by the two large buttons that serve as handy controls for launching workouts or waking the display. This display is also touch-responsive, which I found functioned well generally. There were moments when taps and swipes didn’t seem to register immediately. These incidents were infrequent and minor when compared to the general user-friendliness of the device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027176/19272" target="_top" id="2027176">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027176" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027176/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Bulky-for-extended-wear"><a href="#Comfort-Bulky-for-extended-wear" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Bulky for extended wear"></a>Comfort: Bulky for extended wear</h2><p> The TicWatch Pro 3 shed some weight from its previous iteration, making it slimmer and lighter overall, according to Mobvoi. Still, the stainless steel face isn’t exactly light at 1.48 ounces. The display also measures nearly 1.9 inches across and about 0.5 inches deep. Those dimensions presented challenges for my 5.5-inch wrist.</p><p> The TicWatch Pro 3 shed some weight from its previous iteration, making it slimmer and lighter overall, according to Mobvoi.</p><p> I used the last two notches on the strap to find a close fit and wore it higher on my wrist, but I felt the burden of the weight there. When worn lower, it flopped around and hit my wrist bone when exercising. For those reasons, I’d recommend this watch to users with larger wrists who like large watch faces, as fit issues will be far less likely.</p><p> I did wear this for several nights of sleep since it offers sleep analysis, but the comfort experience didn’t change. It wasn’t uncomfortable to the point that I had to remove it, but I wanted the relief of taking this device off while sleeping because of the weight.</p><p> Contrary to the IP68 rating, Mobvoi doesn’t recommend this for use in the shower or any contact with soapy water—and won’t offer a replacement if you experience performance issues after doing so.</p><p> One surprising and slightly disappointing aspect of the design is the watch’s lack of durability. Though it’s safe for swimming, I avoided showering with it after consulting the product documentation and forums. Contrary to the IP68 rating, Mobvoi doesn’t recommend this for use in the shower or any contact with soapy water—and won’t offer a replacement if you experience performance issues after doing so.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dmQpg73jtc8s6Xxx-CSGe6DOKEc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mobvoi_TicWatch_Pro_3_GPS_04-262f4af125a04f3fab6055508f2c6d3b.jpg"                      alt="Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 GPS"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1172027/12108" target="_top" id="1172027">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1172027" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1172027/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-A-well-rounded-wearable"><a href="#Performance-A-well-rounded-wearable" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A well-rounded wearable"></a>Performance: A well-rounded wearable</h2><p> The Ticwatch Pro 3 comes with a bundle of handy native features such as a flashlight, calculator, alarm clock, and hand-washing timer. Thoughtful extras include built-in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , weather updates, calendar notifications,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nfc-832715" >NFC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> pay via<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-pay-with-google-4163418" >Google Pay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and wellness-oriented tools to track exercise and other essentials such as resting heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) levels, and sleep.</p><p> As a fitness tracker, the TicWatch Pro 3 performs adequately. GPS capture was usually quite fast with some lags on cloudy days, and when compared to a Garmin smartwatch, it wasn’t far off on distance, average page, and heart rate on running workouts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/24UwZRaSR9Dx9_LbhC0ICDpEF2s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mobvoi_TicWatch_Pro_3_GPS_03-35584bf0589a4ad19fcd9280d973018c.jpg"                      alt="Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 GPS"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> Sleep data was a little inconsistent in terms of when the device detected sleep. Sometimes the sleep start times were a couple of hours off. Generally, I was pleased with the presentation of sleep and exercise data. It’s easy enough to glance at results from the watch and entirely forego a companion app.</p><h2 id="Software-Feature-overlap-creates-some-confusion"><a href="#Software-Feature-overlap-creates-some-confusion" class="headerlink" title="Software: Feature overlap creates some confusion"></a>Software: Feature overlap creates some confusion</h2><p> While the TicWatch Pro 3 runs on Wear OS, there is a confusing redundancy with fitness tracking created by the inclusion of both Google Fit and Mobvoi TicWatch fitness widgets. It comes across as an attempt to fill in gaps and also enhance the user experience. For example, the TicOxygen app allows users to track SPO2 levels, which Google Fit lacks. And the TicSleep app uses heart rate and SPO2 readings to offer more detailed sleep data.</p><p> Unsurprisingly, Mobvoi pushes its fitness widgets, but the overlap creates some confusion initially. Additionally, if you like Google Fit and want access to SPO2 data, you’ll need to grant Mobvoi access and download the accompanying app.</p><p> The other downside is that you’ll likely download at least two mobile apps (and perhaps three) to use with one device: Wear OS to set it up, maintain updates, and tweak some settings, Google Fit if you’ll be using those tracking tools, and the Mobvoi app to sync wellness data and integrate this device into your smart home setup if that’s your preferred app for that.</p><p> You have options for catering the experience to you, which is appealing, but this watch does present a bit of an identity crisis between Wear OS and Mobvoi rather than a seamless partnership.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ThEB2Hv12xN060OsalPhyRbn4bY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mobvoi_TicWatch_Pro_3_GPS_05-15d86ca8cd8548709c66efced9dfb14a.jpg"                      alt="Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 GPS"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> This wearable offers the most functionality to Android users as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/complete-guide-to-android-wear-4086408" >Wear OS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> device. Despite not having access to some of the smart features that entice smartwatch shoppers, I was impressed by the relative ease of use with an iPhone.</p><p> Setup was seamless, and so were notifications. While I couldn’t respond to texts or receive calls from the watch, I could use it to answer or decline calls to my phone. And though I didn’t download Spotify from the Google Play store, the default media player made controlling playback from Spotify or my chosen smartphone podcast app very simple.</p><p> The TicWatch Pro 3 does have 8GB of onboard storage, which makes this watch attractive for Android smartphone users who want to use it for onboard music storage. Apps like NavMusic make this easy. Android users also have easier control over and access to third-party fitness, productivity, and other useful apps from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-play-1616720" >Google Play <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> store than iOS users—who will likely find this a bit clunky to manage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880931/19272" target="_top" id="1880931">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880931" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880931/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Solid-72-hour-longevity"><a href="#Battery-Solid-72-hour-longevity" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Solid 72-hour longevity"></a>Battery: Solid 72-hour longevity</h2><p> Mobvoi touts the 72-hour battery life of the TicWatch Pro 3 in smart mode, and it delivers. I used the TicWatch Pro 3 exclusively in this highly connected mode, including a workout a day, and this watch was still chugging along by day three. Of course, battery performance always varies depending on usage. I didn’t run any extra apps, store and play music, or leave the display to the always-on setting, which all helped me reach the three-day mark.</p><p> Mobvoi touts the 72-hour battery life of the TicWatch Pro 3 in smart mode, and it delivers.</p><p> One thing that the TicWatch Pro 3 does exceptionally well is tell time, always. Most smartwatches cease to function when the battery is low or dead, but not this one. I appreciated that at about 5 percent, the device automatically switched to Essential Mode on its own. I didn’t lose the basic time-telling functionality.</p><p> And I was happy to take advantage of other handy battery-saving features, such as Theater Mode, which turns the display off entirely. You won’t have to wait around long for this device to recharge when the time comes. I clocked an average charge time of 100 minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O2h1ls6gDrmzljZ5SvO0QEkrLIE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mobvoi_TicWatch_Pro_3_GPS_02-03e93150d27d41f89e14d807aad2d10d.jpg"                      alt="Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 GPS"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398449/3022" target="_top" id="398449">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398449" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398449/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Price-A-bit-costly-for-those-missing-a-few-premium-features"><a href="#Price-A-bit-costly-for-those-missing-a-few-premium-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bit costly for those missing a few premium features"></a>Price: A bit costly for those missing a few premium features</h2><p> The TicWatch Pro 3 retails for nearly $300, a considerable investment on par with some<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Size-wise, it’s smaller, with 1.2-inch and 1.4-inch case options. Instead of Wear OS, the Watch3 runs on Tizen OS, which is really friendliest to Samsung Galaxy phones—but is widely compatible with Android and iOS mobile devices. The fitness&#x2F;wellness suite also surpasses the TicWatch Pro 3 with advanced metrics such as built-in SPO2, VO2 max, and ECG monitoring. The Watch3 also takes the lead where durability is concerned with military-grade toughness against drops, dust, and water.</p><p> While the Watch3 is physically smaller, both the titanium and stainless steel versions are heavier than the TicWatch Pro 3. It’s also about $100 more expensive. You can’t rely on longer than 24 hours from the Watch3 either, unlike the TicWatch Pro’s 3-day or potential maximum 45-day battery life in Essential Mode. Both of these high-end wearables bring sophistication and tech-savvy to your wrist. Still, operating system preferences, battery life, and fitness extras are significant factors to weigh when determining the better fit.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch3-review-5097671" >Samsung Galaxy Watch3 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A sporty and versatile smartwatch for Android users.</strong></p><p> The Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 GPS is a sporty, sleek smartwatch with good looks and great battery life. While the larger profile won’t fit everyone, Android users, in particular, will find a lot to enjoy about this customizable wearable that functions as a daily workout tracker, smartwatch companion, and reliable time-telling accessory.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-se-review-5088223" >Apple Watch SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-vivomove-hr-review-4843913" >Garmin Vivomove HR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ticwatch-pro-4g-review-4797547" >Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 4G LTE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  TicWatch Pro 3 GPS</li><li>Product Brand  Mobvoi</li><li>UPC  191307000852</li><li>Price  $300.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2020</li><li>Weight  1.48 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.85 x 1.89 x 0.48 in.</li><li>Color  Shadow Black</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Wear OS</li><li>Processor  Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100</li><li>RAM  1GB</li><li>Storage  8GB</li><li>Compatibility  Android, iOS</li><li>Battery Capacity  Up to 72 hours</li><li>Water Resistance  IP68</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth, Wi-Fi</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-exploring-screen-capture-with-apowersoft-no-cost-involved/"><u>[New] Exploring Screen Capture with Apowersoft, No Cost Involved</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-instructions-producing-alluring-video-thumbnails-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step Instructions Producing Alluring Video Thumbnails on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-get-premium-banners-no-cost-just-click/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Get Premium Banners -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> You can tell Microsoft put a considerable amount of thought into the Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard’s design. From the manta ray style folds, which keep shoulders and hands at a relaxed, comfortable angle, to the detached numpad and magnetized risers for increased customization options when you want them, the Sculpt is quite the package. As with anything new, it took a period of adjustment, but we found it relatively quick thanks to the intuitive, easy-to-use design.</p><h2 id="Design-Made-for-comfort"><a href="#Design-Made-for-comfort" class="headerlink" title="Design: Made for comfort"></a><strong>Design: Made for comfort</strong></h2><p> The Sculpt is an ergonomic keyboard with a split design akin to that of a manta ray. The two halves of the keyboard sweep outwards and downwards creating an empty, raised space in the center of its swoop design. Its keys vary in size, with those nearest to the split being slightly wider than those on the outer edges of the keyboard. It’s largely made with plastic and has a bit of a clacky sound as you type. The Sculpt employs a standard layout with a fabric wrist pad at the front for extra comfort. This intuitive, split design combined with the wrist pad help your wrists, hands, and shoulders sit at a neutral, natural angle in order to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >alleviate repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that frequent typists are prone to over time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Cgdvz2K5QV0PheSGAjQNXTdhKP4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_02-e457e23b0c0848dbaad1197549efcc47.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> One unique feature of the Sculpt we loved was the function switch. Located on the upper-right hand side of the keyboard, this switch allows you to toggle the functionality of the top row keys, replacing the function key. Options include refreshing the active page, navigating to the home page in web, opening up the computer’s settings, a play&#x2F;pause button, switching between active windows, and increasing or decreasing volume.</p><p> Located on the upper-right hand side of the keyboard, this switch allows you to toggle the functionality of the top row keys, replacing the function key.</p><p> Often, keyboards include a next track or previous track multimedia feature, which the Sculpt was decidedly lacking. This was a disappointment, but otherwise, the functions are good inclusions and easy to use. If this extra functionality isn’t your thing, you simply flip this switch to the gray position and these F1-F12 keys retain their standard functionality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Batteries-required"><a href="#Setup-Process-Batteries-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Batteries required"></a><strong>Setup Process: Batteries required</strong></h2><p> The Microsoft Sculpt arrives in a box with the Sculpt itself, a detached numpad, a setup guide, a registration number, and a product guide.

Then, take the provided dongle from the compartment and attach it to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your PC. If you’re planning on using the detached numpad, don’t forget to also remove the slip of paper from its backside to active it. Then the Sculpt is ready for use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857869/11832" target="_top" id="857869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857869/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-and-Features-Backlighting-missing-and-just-one-dongle-to-rule-them-all"><a href="#Battery-and-Features-Backlighting-missing-and-just-one-dongle-to-rule-them-all" class="headerlink" title="Battery and Features: Backlighting missing, and just one dongle to rule them all"></a><strong>Battery and Features: Backlighting missing, and just one dongle to rule them all</strong></h2><p> Backlighting—we love it, but the Sculpt doesn’t have it. This is, in large part, thanks to its battery-powered design. It wouldn’t make a great deal of sense for the Sculpt to have backlighting since the two AAA<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-aa-and-aaa-rechargeable-batteries-4134295" >alkaline batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would drain significantly faster, but we sure did miss it. It’s important to note that our love of backlighting is also a matter of personal preference. If it’s important to you, you might want to consider a different model. If you can live without it, the Sculpt still has a lot to offer.</p><p> Encrypted keystrokes, wireless technology, a detached numpad, a magnetic riser, and an ergonomic design make this keyboard a surefire winner.</p><p> One major drawback to the Sculpt’s design is the dongle that associates the keyboard to your PC is one of a kind. This is thanks to the AES 128-bit encryption technology the Sculpt uses to keep your keystrokes safe. Associated to the keyboard at the factory, there simply is no replacing it if it’s lost. While the Sculpt isn’t really travel-friendly due to its size, it would do best in an environment where it’s set up once and stays put so as to prevent losing this important piece of tech.</p><h2 id="Price-Great-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Great-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for the features"></a><strong>Price: Great for the features</strong></h2><p> Ergonomic keyboards tend to cost anywhere from $50-$200. Generally retailing for around $90 on Amazon or $129.95 MSRP, the Sculpt sits in the middle. Its features are nice for the price, too. Encrypted keystrokes, wireless technology, a detached numpad, a magnetic riser, and an ergonomic design with a wrist pad for extra comfort makes this keyboard surefire winner in our books.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BarmRhIEQlGkF0UEDLP9peOh3co=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_05-646724c396184c12836f3f2ce2ced675.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> The Sculpt’s main competition is the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard. It’s a split-style ergonomic keyboard that connects wirelessly to a PC. Instead of using plastic materials, the Surface has a higher quality build that is not only more comfortable but slightly more sound-absorbent as well. And, better yet, the Surface uses the fan-favorite Alcantara fabric, an Italian material with a suede-like feel to it, as part of its wrist pad which makes it incredibly comfortable. Its numpad is attached, however, and it doesn’t include a magnetic riser. If you prefer your wrist sitting at a raised, more neutral angle, or if you like the idea of a detached numpad, the Sculpt is the clear winner here.</p><p> One major drawback to the Sculpt’s design is the dongle that associates the keyboard to your PC is one of a kind.</p><p> Another major difference between them is the Surface doesn’t have a unique dongle associated with it at the factory. So long as your PC has a Bluetooth dongle or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412" >Bluetooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technology built-in, the Surface can connect easily and quickly, but that also means that the Surface’s keystrokes aren’t encrypted.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-ergonomic-keyboard-review-4780282" >Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vn9L7kezNDVwJaDwHzeLbefGfDA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_04-df81d8c1ef3c4387ab900dfa381e1e0f.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> The Surface is a high-end keyboard, but that quality comes at a higher price. The Surface tends to retail for around $129, much more than the Sculpt which retails for around $80. That said, it’s an upgrade in almost every way. If you’re on a budget, the Sculpt is a great option, but if you’re able to splurge, the Surface is our top pick for wireless ergonomic keyboards.</p><p> Check out our other reviews of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >best ergonomic keyboards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> available on the market today.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A secure, mid-priced wireless keyboard with lots of customization options.</strong></p><p> The Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard is a great mid-priced wireless keyboard with multiple customization options thanks to its detached numpad and magnetic riser. Combined with its AES 128-bit encryption technology, comfortable wrist pad, and handy function switch, it’s a great investment for the price. The intuitive, natural angles it creates will have your hands thanking you later.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136616/26400" target="_top" id="2136616">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136616" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136616/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>Price  $80.95</li><li>Weight  2 lbs.</li><li>Model Number  5KV-00001</li><li>Keyboard Dimensions  15.4 x 8.96 x 2.5 in.</li><li>Numpad Dimensions  5.2 x 3.65 x 1.0 in.</li><li>Encryption  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-bit Encryption</li><li>Keyboard Battery  2 AAA alkaline batteries and a 3V Lithium CR2430 battery</li><li>Numpad Battery  3V lithium CR2430 battery</li><li>Compatibility  Windows, Mac 10.7 and higher, Android 3.2 and higher</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-guide-to-saving-insta-story-content-for-2024/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step Guide to Saving Insta Story Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-capture-and-save-windows-11-screens-effortlessly-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capture & Save Windows 11 Screens Effortlessly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-perfect-your-pitch-with-android-the-ultimate-list-of-voice-alteration-apps/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Perfect Your Pitch with Android The Ultimate List of Voice Alteration Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/2024s-ultimate-guide-to-comfortable-keyboard-cushions/"><u>2024'S Ultimate Guide to Comfortable Keyboard Cushions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/a-closer-look-at-leadership-challenges-in-tropico-6s-envisioned-tropical-utopia/"><u>A Closer Look at Leadership Challenges in Tropico 6'S Envisioned Tropical Utopia</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/a-complete-walkthrough-for-improving-pc-graphic-capabilities-with-a-new-card/"><u>A Complete Walkthrough for Improving PC Graphic Capabilities with a New Card</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/advancing-with-windows-11-64-bit-forget-the-32-bit-version/"><u>Advancing with Windows 11 (64-Bit): Forget the 32-Bit Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-audiophile-experience-an-insightful-look-into-series-3-paww/"><u>Affordable Audiophile Experience: An Insightful Look Into Series 3 (Paww)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/amazon-halo-review-the-revolutionary-and-intimate-approach-to-personal-health-tracking/"><u>Amazon Halo Review: The Revolutionary and Intimate Approach to Personal Health Tracking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/canva-and-chatgpt-integration-for-high-volume-design-outputs/"><u>Canva and ChatGPT Integration for High-Volume Design Outputs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/free-guide-transferring-your-dvd-collection-onto-your-huawei-device-step-by-step-tutorial/"><u>Free Guide: Transferring Your DVD Collection Onto Your Huawei Device -
