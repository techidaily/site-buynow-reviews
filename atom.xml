Although Watch Dogs: Legion released without online gameplay (it became available in December 2020), you can play the campaign mode on PC or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> right now. Is this game worth the time and monetary investment? I played Watch Dogs: Legion for 30 hours to find out, evaluating its story, gameplay, graphics, to see how it compares to other titles.</p><h2 id="Setting-and-Plot-Fun-but-predictable"><a href="#Setting-and-Plot-Fun-but-predictable" class="headerlink" title="Setting and Plot: Fun, but predictable"></a><strong>Setting and Plot: Fun, but predictable</strong></h2><p> Watch Dogs: Legion is set in a near-future version of London. The game accurately depicts landmarks, as well as the overall vibe of the city, but it’s a fictional version of London with a heavy tech theme. You have a few different enemies — a group consisting of private military, state operatives, and organized crime, as well as a hacker group called Zero Day. Zero Day pulls off a major terrorist operation in London. This causes the government to give power to a military group (Albion), and that group promptly implements a martial law type system of oppression.</p><p> You’re part of a group called DedSec, and you and your associates were framed for the terrorist act, although Zero Day were the real culprits. You now need to rebuild the organization, work to take down the multiple groups, and give London back to the people “V for Vendetta”-style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/w01z_qW1xkiYdMVSg0obsvGJ2NU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Watch-Dogs-Legion-PC-3-042727c8603245bfbcde2e3b67ab7ed8.jpg"                      alt="Watch Dogs: Legion car chase"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> In the opening mission, you play as an agent infiltrating Parliament. You set traps, fight a few guys in hand-to-hand combat, and shoot some bad guys with the goal of preventing the building from being blown to smithereens. The early tutorial type missions help get you acquainted with the game and its systems. The game takes you through the downfall of DedSec, walks you through the beginning of setting up the rebuilding of DedSec, and you select your very first recruit to your legion. There’s a pretty good selection of starting characters, and I selected a Board Game Designer who has the ability to summon a personal drone.</p><p> The story is a tale of a resistance group fighting against an oppressive government group. The story kept me interested, although the plot bordered on predictable. The game has quite a few protagonists, which added interest, but also caused the characters to lack depth. Of all the characters, I thought Bagley was the most fun— with humor and sarcastic comments that made me chuckle. I also liked the spider drone’s missions, and I jumped around saying “wee” as I played the spider missions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UOpYTu-WYh_4Z_Icu9ZD7aLW78Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Watch-Dogs-Legion-PC-4-a1beafe90fe7494b84b19f97e292c2ab.jpg"                      alt="Watch Dogs: Legion spider drone"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> Once you complete the opening scene, the game is presented like most open world games — pick a mission, drive to it, complete the mission, and repeat. There are plenty of distractions and side missions to take part in like collecting text and audio files, finding the tech points which allow you to upgrade, participating in bare-knuckle fighting, delivering packages, and drinking a beer, and applying paste-ups. You can also shop for clothes.</p><p> Watch Dogs: Legions isn’t exactly revolutionary, and most of it is somewhat run of the mill. There is a feeling of “been there done that,” but there were some exciting aspects.</p><p> Watch Dogs: Legion looks incredible, with great draw distances, and an incredibly detailed world.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Cool-character-engine-redundant-missions"><a href="#Gameplay-Cool-character-engine-redundant-missions" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Cool character engine, redundant missions"></a><strong>Gameplay: Cool character engine, redundant missions</strong></h2><p> Watch Dogs: Legion is an open world action-adventure game. I played on PC, and I used an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/games-console-reviews-4102640" >Xbox controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The controls were tight, intuitive, and consistently responsive. It felt natural to run through the world, climb, and drive. I was especially impressed with the vehicles, as you can feel the difference when you’re driving a sports car versus when you’re driving a bus.</p><p> Fighting is simple yet satisfying, with a dodge and counter system that feels realistic, and interesting finishing moves. Shooting feels pretty ok too— the aiming works well, and the duck and cover system feels natural. Cut scenes are very well done. They don’t feel arbitrarily thrown in, and they’re well integrated in the game engine. The main storyline takes around 20 hours, but it’ll take much longer if you play all the side missions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fT7PRS6tGlloKdqVFXl8H-TPrVY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Watch-Dogs-Legion-PC-2-ed238e68324c450997c310f225ff57a6.jpg"                      alt="Watch Dogs: Legion character creation"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> On the plus side, you can play as any character you encounter, and you can switch characters anytime you like, except in the middle of missions. When you do switch, the characters have a conversation that feels kind of like a hand off. I thought this was a nice touch. You can also customize characters with clothes and new masks. However, since I was switching characters so often and I wasn’t playing online, I didn’t have much motivation to customize specific characters. The clothing felt tacked on, like more of an obligatory feature in an open world game rather than an actual benefit.</p><p> The best part of Watch Dogs: Legion is the ability to use so many different characters. Many of the character’s weapons matched their occupation or theme too. For instance, the beekeeper attacks with a swarm of bees, and the janitor’s special power is to avoid detection by sweeping. The game had funny characters as well, like a construction worker who has trouble sneaking around due to flatulence.</p><p> The controls were tight, intuitive, and consistently responsive.</p><p> I did, however, encounter a few issues. I started to run into doppelgangers in the world. I came across people with the exact same faces and build, but different clothes and skills. The game actually provided me two characters with the exact same face as rewards for completing missions. This took a bit of the magic away for me. The game even crashed once while I was playing.</p><p> Most missions wound up feeling pretty redundant, especially after playing for a while. I’d approach a building, hack cameras and set traps, send in the spider drones for some easy knockouts, then go in and complete the area. There were some fun missions along the main story which offered some variety, but most missions are best completed with stealth, which can slow down the game sometimes.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Top-notch"><a href="#Graphics-Top-notch" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Top notch"></a><strong>Graphics: Top notch</strong></h2><p> Watch Dogs: Legion looks incredible, with great draw distances, and an incredibly detailed world. Everything visually works, and I really enjoyed looking at the people and landmarks in the world.</p><p> On PC, this game can easily eat a lot of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/increase-vram-on-a-windows-pc-5072150" >VRAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as the Very High setting almost maxed out my PC at 1920x1080 (with an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r11-review-5075589" >Alienware Aurora R11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with an RTX 2060 graphics card). I could not run the game on ultra settings. On high, it looks great, running at a solid<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optimizing-video-game-frame-rates-811784" >60fps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/K-AWpBjCaRJlrJ0G-xBMEG92pQo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Watch-Dogs-Legion-PC-7-87aeabc18ddb4bca8252d33fcb1f20bf.jpg"                      alt="Watch Dogs: Legion mission"                ></p><p> Erika Rawes &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Price-The-usual-60"><a href="#Price-The-usual-60" class="headerlink" title="Price: The usual $60"></a><strong>Price: The usual $60</strong></h2><p> Watch Dogs: Legions sells for $60 for the standard edition. The Gold Edition sells for $100, and the Ultimate and Collectors Editions sell for $120 and $190, respectively. Everything above the standard edition comes with extra missions and a season pass, but these perks don’t really seem worth the added cost.</p><p> There’s just not enough multiplayer meat on the bone or story to justify paying that much more. The $60 price even feels a little high for this game. If you really love open world games, the $60 price might be worth it to you, especially since you can upgrade at no additional cost to the next-gen version if you buy the game on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but you might not get as much playtime out of Watch Dogs: Legion as you would other $60 titles.</p><p> The story kept me interested, although the plot bordered on predictable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1492813">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1492813">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1492813%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1492813/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Watch-Dogs-Legion-vs-Grand-Theft-Auto-Series"><a href="#Watch-Dogs-Legion-vs-Grand-Theft-Auto-Series" class="headerlink" title="Watch Dogs: Legion vs. Grand Theft Auto Series"></a><strong>Watch Dogs: Legion vs. Grand Theft Auto Series</strong></h2><p> It feels as though Ubisoft is definitely going for a GTA vibe here—go see a person, start a mission, complete the mission, rinse, and repeat. In addition to its visually interesting world, Watch Dogs: Legion adds in the ability to play as anyone you encounter, and that’s perhaps its biggest draw. The next GTA may not arrive for quite a while, so for those who want a new open world right now, Watch Dogs: Legion might be a viable alternative.</p><p> Final Verdict: A good, but not great open world experience.</p><p> Watch Dogs: Legion feels like a missed opportunity, with a “play as anyone” feature that’s cool, but not cool enough to compensate for the lack of novelty. The addition of online play may offer more replayability, but as of launch, there isn’t enough to keep us coming back.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135471">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135471%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135471/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Watch Dogs: Legion</li><li>Price  $59.99</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>ESRB Rating  Mature 17+</li><li>Platform  Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, PC, and Stadia</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-video-setup-starter-kit-for-excursion-documentation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Video Setup Starter Kit for Excursion Documentation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-all-inclusive-screen-recorder-azs-app-analysis/"><u>[New] All-Inclusive Screen Recorder - AZ's App Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-tailoring-rss-files-for-impact-a-podcasters-blueprint/"><u>[New] Tailoring RSS Files for Impact A Podcaster's Blueprint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-navigating-youtube-skip-the-top-8-novice-missteps/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Navigating YouTube Skip the Top 8 Novice Missteps!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/experience-a-budget-friendly-fitness-with-the-fitbit-versa-in-depth-review/"><u>Experience a Budget-Friendly Fitness with the Fitbit Versa – In-Depth Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/m1-revolution-unveiled-in-apples-2020-macbook-pro-13-inch-laptop-review/"><u>M1 Revolution Unveiled in Apple's 2020 MacBook Pro 13-Inch Laptop Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/navigating-tiktok-profile-updates-with-linktree-integration-for-2024/"><u>Navigating TikTok Profile Updates with Linktree Integration for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/nintendos-switch-lite-a-budget-conscious-portable-console-alternative-examined-in-our-review/"><u>Nintendo's Switch Lite – A Budget-Conscious, Portable Console Alternative Examined in Our Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/no-budget-no-problem-the-finest-free-voice-alterer-for-valorant-players-for-2024/"><u>No Budget?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Apple is no stranger to creating minimal devices, but the 21.5-inch 4K iMac takes things to a whole new level with a screen that pops and a design that looks stylish no matter the setting. As beautiful as it is on the outside, under the hood you also have a solid set of components with a 3.4GHz 7th generation quad-core Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 1TB Fusion Drive. Apple has managed to pack quite a bit of power inside the slender frame. We put it to the test to see how it fares for multimedia and productivity uses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TCcSm-nkER9HhHM8YIPMWbaezRA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-4-fa6cf253bfd44ab991c366691b68bdf5.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements"><a href="#Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements" class="headerlink" title="Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements"></a><strong>Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements</strong></h2><p> It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >beautiful machine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from top to bottom. Before even turning it on, the design of the computer a striking, aluminum-clad body that’s still subtle enough that it will blend in with nearly any office or home environment.</p><p> The tapered design makes the edges appear almost non-existent while its bulkier behind manages to round things out in a proportional manner. At its thinnest point — the edges — the iMac measures in at just 0.2 inches. On its integrated stand, the iMac measures in at 17.7 inches tall, 20.8 inches wide, and 6.9 inches deep. Amazingly, all of that weighs in at just 12.5 pounds, not including the keyboard and mouse.</p><p> Overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package.</p><p> Aside from the Apple logo on the front aluminum chin of the iMac, all of the connections and ports on the iMac are on the rear of the computer. This includes, left to right: a 3.5mm headphone jack, SD card slot, four USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 3.0 ports (USB-C), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and power adapter. There’s also a Kensington lock slot to let you secure the the iMac.</p><p> We would’ve liked to see a thinner bezel around the screen, as the one present on the iMac is about half an inch — much larger than even the most basic PC monitors. It’d be a bit different if Apple were doing more with that real estate, but as it stands, it feels like wasted space</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gM_JxuZjDbSUs7DYtXIwUIqqz0Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-3-d30c5f8414e94cbd9b1ec8aea9b18950.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go"></a><strong>Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go</strong></h2><p> One of Apple’s core tenets is simplicity, and the 4K iMac is no exception to this rule. Inside the box is the computer itself and a box which contains the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. Additional components include the power connection for the computer, a Lightning cable for charging the mouse and keyboard, and a small package of documentation.</p><p> Setting up the iMac is as simple as unwrapping it from its protective cover, setting it on the desk, plugging it in with the included power cord, and pressing the power button. As it boots up, we turned on the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. By the time the iMac was to the setup screen — a process that took approximately 60 seconds — the two were already paired with the computer and ready to be used.</p><p> Going through the setup process took us approximately five minutes, which included setting up our iCloud account and getting the various login settings in place. We opted to set this up as a new computer, but there’s also the ability to set it up from an Apple Time Capsule backup or transfer content from a PC via USB. The amount of time those options take will vary depending on the device you’re transferring the information from as well as the amount of data being transferred.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury" target="_top" id="2120863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine"><a href="#Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine"></a><strong>Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine</strong></h2><p> With a resolution of 4096 x 2304 pixels, the 4K iMac has more than 9.4 million pixels and features a pixel density of 217 pixels per inch, more than enough to make individual pixels indistinguishable at normal viewing distances.

Unlike a traditional hard drive (HDD), which relies exclusively on spinning platters to write and read information, Apple’s Fusion Drive also adds a small solid state storage (SSD) partition. This is where the operating system and most critical applications are stored, as solid state memory is much faster than traditional HDDs. The result is a drive that offers some of the advantages of SSDs while still offering the more affordable price tag and capacity of HDDs.</p><p> In our tests, boot-up time ranged from 15 seconds to 25 seconds. Considering the hybrid-style Fusion Drive, this lines up with our expectations, falling right between SSD speeds and HDD speeds. The same held true with boot-up times for various applications, ranging from Safari to more resource-intensive applications such as Final Cut Pro.</p><p> Moving onto the CPU and GPU benchmarks, we tested the iMac with both Geekbench and Cinebench to see how well the 3.4GHz quad-core processor and AMD Radeon Pro 560 held up.</p><p> “Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac.”</p><p> In the Geekbench tests, the iMac scored 4,866 on the single core test, 14,151 on the multi-core test, and 56,974 on the OpenCL score. This falls in line with other iMacs of the same specifications and hovers around other computers with similar specifications. In Cinebench, the iMac achieved 93.86 frames per second in the OpenGL test and a score of 584 cb in the CPU test.</p><p> All-in-all, the iMac seems to punch right at or above its specifications when compared to similar hardware. It’s not going to be pumping out 8K footage, but for basic 4K video editing and image post-processing, the graphics card is more than enough. As for productivity, there’s not much you can throw at the iMac that it can’t handle. The only thing we noticed slowing down the computer was the 8GB of RAM when we had over a dozen applications open, but that can be fixed by upgrading to the 16GB or 32GB model (although it’s not a cheap upgrade).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118315/7443" target="_top" id="2118315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118315/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Fast-and-reliable"><a href="#Network-Fast-and-reliable" class="headerlink" title="Network: Fast and reliable"></a><strong>Network: Fast and reliable</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac features both wired and wireless connectivity for internet access. As previously mentioned, the iMac features a Gigabit Ethernet (RJ-45) port on the rear of the computer for a hardwired internet connection. For Wi-Fi, the iMac uses an 802.11ac network adapter with support for IEEE 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n.</p><p> In our hardwired tests, the iMac maxed out our Gigabit fiber optic internet no problem, with steady download and upload speeds. Wireless connectivity was equally impressive, regardless of whether the iMac was in the same room as the router or a few rooms over. We didn’t notice any drops throughout our tests and both uploading and downloading content was consistent.</p><h2 id="Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks"><a href="#Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks"></a><strong>Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks</strong></h2><p> The only camera on the 4K iMac is the integrated webcam, which sits dead center above the display. We would’ve liked to see a 1080p or even 4K webcam included, but the 720p resolution is good enough for basic video messaging.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rFu0_k9BjbUxQdoEYOcNGU35LJA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-2-a3d2f38b9509480ba41bbb5b33815d1a.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118324/7443" target="_top" id="2118324">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118324" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118324/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Software-Everything-you-need-and-nothing-more"><a href="#Software-Everything-you-need-and-nothing-more" class="headerlink" title="Software: Everything you need and nothing more"></a><strong>Software: Everything you need and nothing more</strong></h2><p> As with all Apple computers, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac comes with macOS Mojave pre-installed. If you’re used to macOS as a whole, you’ll feel right at home as we did. Compared to past versions of macOS, Mojave improves in a number of areas, including an integrated Dark mode that turns much of the user interface dark grey to spare your eyes. There’s also a feature called “Stacks” that intelligently combines files of the same type on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Improved<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-screenshot-1701742" >screenshot functionality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also makes snapping your screen easier.</p><p> One of the stand-out benefits of macOS is that you’ll never have to worry about paid upgrades. Apple annually announces and subsequently releases a new operating system, free of charge, to install on Apple computers. In-between major releases Apple will also push out incremental updates, at least two of which we installed during our review process. These incremental installs can be done either manually within the System Preferences applications or be set to install themselves automatically when the computer is plugged in and powered on.</p><p> Unlike Windows, macOS doesn’t come with any bloatware either. There’s a number of pre-installed apps developed by Apple, including four new ones borrowed from Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, but most of the pre-installed apps are the standard array of programs you’d expect to see on any modern computer.</p><h2 id="Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real"><a href="#Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real" class="headerlink" title="Price: The Apple tax is real"></a><strong>Price: The Apple tax is real</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac we tested with the aforementioned specifications retails for $1,499. Compared to other Windows PCs with similar specifications, the iMac is without pricey for the specs it offers. However, this is par for the course with Apple, so much so that the term “Apple tax” has become a commonly-used phrase. What you’re paying for is the entire package, wrapped up in one of the best-looking frames out there.</p><p> Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac. If you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem and don’t need to shell out for the more expensive 27-inch 5K iMac, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is priced much more reasonably and still has plenty to offer.</p><h2 id="Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market"><a href="#Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A unique option in a small market"></a><strong>Competition: A unique option in a small market</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac has a few competitors in its specification range, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two: the Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO 700 and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.asus.com/displays-desktops/all-in-one-pcs/zen-aio/" >Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> All three all-in-one desktops feature 4K displays (or at least the option to order them with 4K displays). Aside from that, the specifications also line up similarly, with i7 CPU configurations, dedicated GPU options, SSD variations, and beefy memory choices.</p><p> Of course, the biggest difference between the three desktops is that the 21.5-inch 4K iMac runs macOS while the other two run Windows 10. Using Apple’s included Boot Camp program, it’s possible to run Windows 10 (and other operating systems) on the iMac, but macOS isn’t able to be run on the other devices.</p><p> Other differences include various connections options on the back of the computers and variations in size—most notably the iMac is quite a bit smaller in dimensions across the board. That said, the larger size allows easier access to internals which makes upgrading easier on the Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 700 and Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC.</p><p> Prices vary greatly between the three desktops depending on the configuration you’re looking for, but overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac seems to hold its own in this price range, despite Apple’s notoriety for being a little bit on the pricier side.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Beautiful display in a thin, powerful machine.</strong></p><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package. It’s not going to blow anyone away on benchmarks and it’s not cheap for the internal components you’re getting, but it has a lot to offer for multimedia and productivity. That’s not to mention the sheer convenience of having everything simply work out of the box.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-studio-2-review-4689102" >Microsoft Surface Studio 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r7-review-4689097" >Alienware Aurora R7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkcentre-m720-tower-review-4776238" >Lenovo ThinkCentre M720 Tower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993651">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993651">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"                      style="border: none;

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is one of the most portable and convenient travel air compressors you can buy. Its intuitive design allows anyone to fill up a low tire easily. It also has additional safety features that allow you to be seen at night and, if necessary, signal that you’re in distress. And when you’re done with it, it’s easy to pack up and store. Tradeoffs for these benefits include a small<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >LCD display <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a short air hose, but given its intended function, those are trivial concerns.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Simple-compact-intuitive"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Simple-compact-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Simple, compact, intuitive"></a><strong>Design and Features: Simple, compact, intuitive</strong></h2><p> At just 7.5 inches wide, 2.5 inches tall and 6 inches long, this is the smallest, most compact portable tire inflator we tested. When it’s in its carrying case, it only weighs 2 pounds, 31 ounces. Even small children should be able to carry it. If you need a portable tire inflator but don’t have a lot of space, this pump is exactly what you want.</p><p> The control panel is as about as basic and simple as it gets. The functions of its large buttons are clearly marked, which makes it incredibly intuitive. Even those who don’t read the owners manual will be able to learn how to use it effectively in just a few seconds.</p><p> Like much of the competition, this air compressor has an auto-shutoff feature (Jaco calls it SmartPressure) that allows you to preset the tire pressure you want before the pump goes to work.</p><p> The control panel’s 1.5-inch LCD is the smallest display we saw among the devices we tested, nevertheless, it’s perfectly readable in the sun and at night. It displays tire pressure in PSI (pound per square inch)I, BAR (atmospheric pressure), and Kpa (kilopascal). If you live in the United States, chances are that you’ll exclusively use PSI. But if you ever need to measure pressure in the metric system or SI (International System of Units), you’ll be glad you have the ability.</p><p> Like much of the competition, this air compressor has an auto-shutoff feature (Jaco calls it SmartPressure) that allows you to preset the tire pressure you want before the pump goes to work. When you turn it on, it will pump air until the desired pressure is achieved and turn itself off. This is great because it means you don’t have to constantly monitor it to make sure you don’t overfill your tires.</p><p> Most portable tire inflators draw their power from a 12V adapter attached to the power cord. The SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is no different. Simply plug the adapter into your car’s 12V socket (cigarette lighter), turn your car on and the pump powers up immediately. This is a great convenience compared to pumps like the Viair 88P Portable Compressor which requires you to hook it up to your car’s battery, jumper-cable style.</p><p> The built-in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is more useful than any of the portable tire compressors we tested. It not only illuminates the tire you’re inflating but also much of the surrounding area. Additionally, you can set the light to flash hazard signals so oncoming traffic can spot you better at night. It even has the ability to flash S.O.S. in morse code to signal a serious emergency that you need immediate assistance with.</p><p> Unlike some of its competition, the SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator has excellent cord and hose management. The air hose and power cord have separate compartments built into the pump’s housing, and they both fit snugly for easy storage. Another portable air compressor we tested, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator, has extremely awkward cord management that results in frustration and cables jutting out the side of the device when it’s not in use.</p><p> The functions of its large buttons are clearly marked, which makes it incredibly intuitive. Even those who don’t read owners manual will be able to learn how to use it effectively in just a few seconds.</p><p> The air-hose on this portable compressor is a scant 24 inches, which means that you have to be within two feet of the tire or object you’re inflating. This is fine if you only plan on using it for regular tire pressure maintenance and “just-in-case” scenarios. Fortunately, the 10-foot power cord provides enough range to reach every tire on your vehicle.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-less-than-three-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-less-than-three-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Up and running in less than three minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process: Up and running in less than three minutes</strong></h2><p> Jaco provides a brief, but informative user manual tucked in the carrying case. Despite how intuitive this pump is to use, you should take five minutes to read the whole thing. During testing, we timed how long it takes to get out of your driver’s seat, retrieve the pump from the trunk, connect it to power, attach it to an under-inflated tire, set the pressure and start the pump. On average, the whole process took about 1 minute, 30 seconds.</p><p> Simply plug the adapter into your car’s 12V socket (cigarette lighter), turn your car on and the pump powers up immediately.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115929/19272" target="_top" id="2115929">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115929" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115929/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Reliable-across-the-highways-of-America"><a href="#Performance-Reliable-across-the-highways-of-America" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Reliable across the highways of America"></a><strong>Performance: Reliable across the highways of America</strong></h2><p> In order to recreate the situations that you’re most likely to use a portable tire inflator, we took the models we tested on a long road trip through the states of Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. When we stopped at rural rest areas and gas stations along the way, we deflated the tires on our car to 20 PSI—the point where they are dangerously low to drive on.</p><p> We timed how long it took the Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator to re-inflate the tires to the recommended 32 PSI. On average, it took about 2 minutes, 13 seconds to fill the tires. This represents the slowest fill time of the portable air compressors we tested, while the fastest average we recorded was 55 seconds.</p><p> Unlike some of its competition, the SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator has excellent cord and hose management.</p><p> We checked the accuracy of the pressure gauge by comparing its readings to that of a simple pencil-style gauge. Each time we took a reading, they matched within a 0.5 PSI range. That’s as about as close to perfect that you can expect.</p><p> Any air compressor is going to generate a lot of noise, so we used a sound meter to measure how loud this tire inflator gets while running. We recorded sound levels up to 97 decibels, but it was usually a steady 95 decibels. Although the sound is grating, you won’t have to wear protection unless you plan to have it continually running for hours.</p><p> That also shouldn’t be an issue because the pump automatically cycles down after 30 minutes of continuous use, and you’ll have to wait until it cools down to use it again. This shouldn’t be a problem, since you can conceivably fill all four of your car’s tires in under 10 minutes. You’d have to inflate something exceptionally large to run this pump for that long.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134489/18498" target="_top" id="2134489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134489/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-On-the-expensive-end-but-worth-it-for-the-peace-of-mind"><a href="#Price-On-the-expensive-end-but-worth-it-for-the-peace-of-mind" class="headerlink" title="Price: On the expensive end, but worth it for the peace of mind"></a><strong>Price: On the expensive end, but worth it for the peace of mind</strong></h2><p> With a list price of $90, this is the most expensive portable tire inflator we tested, but it’s typically on sale for half the price. That makes it more reasonable, especially if you need a portable compressor but are really tight on space. Or if you want to ensure maximum safety and visibility at night. But it certainly isn’t a budget model like the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump.</p><p> It’s impossible to predict how long a product will last after just a few days or using it, however, the warranty period is a good indicator of the long-term durability. Jaco offers a lifetime warranty on this compressor, so it should last a really long time, or at least until you forget it’s still under warranty.</p><h2 id="Jaco-SmartPro-Digital-Tire-Inflator-vs-Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator"><a href="#Jaco-SmartPro-Digital-Tire-Inflator-vs-Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator" class="headerlink" title="Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator vs. Kensun Portable Tire Inflator"></a><strong>Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator vs. Kensun Portable Tire Inflator</strong></h2><p> We tested this the SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator side-by-side with the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator. Although the Kensun is about twice as large as the Jaco, they’re designed to do the same thing. For example, they both draw power from your car’s 12V socket, but if you want to get away from your car, the Kensun comes with an AC power cord that you can plug into a wall socket. This makes the Kensun a much more versatile pump. And while the built-in light on the Kensun provides great illumination at night, it lacks the hazard and emergency lights you get with Jaco.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/kensun-portable-tire-inflator-review-4776821" >Kensun Portable Tire Inflator Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The best tire inflator you can buy with tons of features and value.</strong></p><p> The Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is a great addition to the jumper cables and triangle reflectors in your trunk. Its focus on safety, portability, and accuracy makes it very attractive for people looking to be prepared, and you can usually find it on sale for a reasonable price.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator Pump</li><li>Product Brand  Jaco</li><li>UPC  X000UZJE09</li><li>Price  $89.99</li><li>Release Date  September 2015</li><li>Weight  2.05 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.5 x 2.5 x 6 in.</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/rom-ordinary-to-outstanding-crafting-unique-shorts-thumbnails/"><u>[New] From Ordinary to Outstanding Crafting Unique Shorts Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-redesigning-the-perception-of-sony-s3700-review/"><u>[New] Redesigning the Perception of Sony S3700 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-why-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s5e-reigns-as-an-android-tablet-king/"><u>Comprehensive Review: Why the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e Reigns as an Android Tablet King</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-samsung-cf591-assessment-top-choice-for-gamers/"><u>Comprehensive Samsung CF591 Assessment: Top Choice for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/corsair-one-pro-review-a-creative-and-efficient-gaming-pc/"><u>Corsair One Pro Review: A Creative and Efficient Gaming PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/experience-next-level-gaming-on-philipss-49-inch-proven-oled-curved-screen/"><u>Experience Next-Level Gaming on Philips's 49-Inch Proven OLED Curved Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/fix-vcompdll-cannot-be-located-error-a-step-by-step-solution/"><u>Fix Vcomp.dll Cannot Be Located Error: A Step-by-Step Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/forza-horizon-5-pc-optimization-guide-increase-frame-rate-effectively/"><u>Forza Horizon 5 PC Optimization Guide: Increase Frame Rate Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-is-the-best-pokemon-for-pokemon-pvp-ranking-on-itel-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, What is the best Pokemon for pokemon pvp ranking On Itel A05s? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/insightful-viewership-data-for-your-insta-pics/"><u>Insightful Viewership Data for Your Insta Pics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/insta360-one-x2-review-immersive-wet-and-ready-to-dive-in/"><u>Insta360 One X2 Review: Immersive, Wet & Ready to Dive In</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/install-new-razer-drivers-on-your-pc-running-windows-10-8-7-xp-or-vista-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Install New Razer Drivers on Your PC Running Windows 10, 8, 7, XP or Vista – Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/revolutionary-tech-mastery-exploring-the-superiority-of-iphone-12-by-apple/"><u>Revolutionary Tech Mastery: Exploring the Superiority of iPhone 12 by Apple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ltimate-list-of-engaging-history-content-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate List of Engaging History Content on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unlocking-value-with-the-apple-watch-series-se-a-cost-conscious-review/"><u>Unlocking Value with the Apple Watch Series SE: A Cost-Conscious Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A good webcam has HD resolution, quality sound, and is easy to use. We tested the Logitech C615 Webcam to see whether it can deliver what you need to start recording your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/86PZ5XCiq91ihr7-8UNmM5io9pY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_4_Final_Horiz-bad356a5002b4156859dca672e8a8eb4.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Design-Flexible-foldable-design"><a href="#Design-Flexible-foldable-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Flexible, foldable design"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>Flexible, foldable design</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 is a compact webcam. The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you’re prone to losing things, this may be an issue.</p><p> The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.</p><p> The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.</p><p> The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jgQ_lVlvzgmXFPpBg5nEd6pgV_c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_12_Final_Horiz-e97c48d3af6842eb88775a9d703ce2b6.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles</strong></h2><p> The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.</p><p> Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.</p><p> The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.</p><p> The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bko9Uk1HIIMt9aNgtBf9ATCy0AA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_14_Final_Horiz-4f1b9fe91b8c4229b17dbbe6afb81b8c.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115928/19272" target="_top" id="2115928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic"><a href="#Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic"></a><strong>Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic</strong></h2><p> We used both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test the performance of the C615. It was very easy to position the camera exactly the way we wanted it, though the USB cable occasionally gave us problems. We’d swivel the camera and then the pull of the USB cable would turn the whole base so the camera pointed back at the same spot where it started.</p><p> When we used Skype to make calls everything worked great. The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone. From 10 feet away, we heard only a small amount of echo in the call. We also tried using the camera mic with video game noise in the background. The camera clearly caught our voices and downplayed the background noise, helping us focus on what we wanted to hear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C2UBXNFmxG8nA0udy1IprMH4LBA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_9_Final_Horiz-1af52951f8704af9b76d7dd1ec9744a9.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098704/14409" target="_top" id="2098704">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098704" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098704/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive HD camera"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive HD camera</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 costs $70 MSRP, but you can find it for about half that cost.

But there’s a reason it retails so cheaply; it’s a nightmare to use, the audio quality is torturous, and the camera doesn’t approach the advertised 12 MP. Despite being nearly $60 more expensive, the C615 is the obvious winner here.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/docooler-usb-20-12-megapixel-review-4784227" >Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong><em>Genius 120-degree Webcam</em> :</strong> The Genius 120-degree Webcam is a full HD model with a wide-angle lens.

With a 10th generation<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >Intel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> processor and a multitude of configuration options, the R11 lets you choose an up-to-date PC that fits in your price range now, and then upgrade later on. The Dell subsidiary’s latest beast comes in six main configurations, ranging from a base model (priced at $930) all the way up to a top tier model that includes two graphics cards (priced at $4,956). I tested the Alienware Aurora R11 for two weeks, evaluating its design, performance, gameplay, audio, network performance, software, upgradability, and cooling. Is the Alienware Aurora R11 a worthwhile investment? Here’s my full review.</p><h2 id="Test-model-10th-Gen-Intel-Core-i7-10700F-and-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-2060"><a href="#Test-model-10th-Gen-Intel-Core-i7-10700F-and-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-2060" class="headerlink" title="Test model: 10th Gen Intel Core i7 10700F and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060"></a><strong>Test model: 10th Gen Intel Core i7 10700F and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060</strong></h2><p> The Aurora R11 is extremely customizable, and you can choose exactly the components you want. You can select either a 10th Gen Core i5, i7, or i9 processor, and for graphics, you can get the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER if you go for the base model, or go all the way up to two (yes, two!) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti cards in the highest tier model.</p><p> In some of the lower-tier models, you can opt for an AMD card. In the second tier, you can swap out an AMD Radeon RX 5700 (8GB GDDR6) graphics card for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB GDDR6) at no additional cost. You can choose your chassis, liquid or air cooling, different wattages, single or dual drives, and different amounts and types of storage.</p><p> I tested the second-tier model with the 10th Gen Intel Core i7 10700F, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB GDDR6), 16 GB of RAM, dual drives (256GB SSD + 1TB SATA), and the Dark Side of the Moon chassis with Low-Profile Smart Cooling CPU Heatsink and 550W Power Supply. The model I tested had air cooling, but you can get liquid cooling in this model for as little as $20 added to the base price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hRBDZ5clhMthsEMeqGYzOi7oIE8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-2-e6bece84be7c48a3af3db3806a85a31e.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135394/19272" target="_top" id="2135394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135394/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-mature-gaming-rig"><a href="#Design-A-mature-gaming-rig" class="headerlink" title="Design: A mature gaming rig"></a><strong>Design: A mature gaming rig</strong></h2><p> While some gaming PC towers boast bold designs with transparent glass, RGB fans, and enough colors to make you feel like you’re at a rave, the Aurora R11 takes a much different design approach. The R11 is unassuming—not too flashy and not too loud. It’s elegant and simple in appearance with subtle strips of lighting on the front trim of the oblong chassis. This looks like a computer for someone with refined taste, as opposed to a colorful spectacle.</p><p> The front is reminiscent of a jet engine, with a raised front panel surrounded by venting slots. The Aurora R11 is large, and takes up a significant amount of space when placed on top of a desk. Clocking in at 17 x 8.8 x 18.9 inches, this is a tower you’d want to place under your desk. I placed it under my desk, but used a lift to help keep the tower off of the floor.</p><p> The Aurora R11 comes in two different chassis color options: A lunar light chassis and a dark side of the moon chassis. The dark side of the moon chassis is all black, while the lunar light option is white with a black front panel. When you power on the R11, the RGB halo ring illuminates around the front panel, and the Alienware symbol lights up. The Alienware symbol doubles as the power button, and you can tune its color, tune how it blinks, and create Macros for specific games. I created a fun blinking Macro for Destiny 2, then quickly got distracted by it and got rid of it. You can, however, set a macro to dim things down while playing and amp it up other times.</p><p> There are ports galore on this rig. It has multiple USB ports, and it even has USB-C ports. One of the front USB ports has PowerShare, which is a nice feature for charging devices.</p><h2 id="Display-OC-Ready"><a href="#Display-OC-Ready" class="headerlink" title="Display: OC Ready"></a><strong>Display: OC Ready</strong></h2><p> The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB GDDR6) has a base clock of 1,365 MHz. The card is OC ready though, so it’s built for overclocking. It supports a maximum resolution of up to 7680 x 4320. The card also supports VR, and multiple monitors (up to four).</p><p> The Aurora R11 doesn’t include a monitor in the package. I connected the R11 to the FreeSync and G-Sync compatible Asus VG245H gaming monitor, which is a 24-inch 1920 x 1080 monitor with a max refresh rate of 144 Hz. Colors displayed as expected, and the text was sharp and clear. Videos ran smoothly, and I didn’t encounter any issues whatsoever with the display quality, nor any of the video port connections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JFFJbdkvNwhJ-T2_-B88xFQhCNQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-4-d7147c6bd520432285a9f2e58f788322.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Performance-An-absolute-powerhouse"><a href="#Performance-An-absolute-powerhouse" class="headerlink" title="Performance: An absolute powerhouse"></a><strong>Performance: An absolute powerhouse</strong></h2><p> I was impressed with the R11’s overall performance, especially considering the model I tested is one of the more affordable configurations. Boot times are fast, and it jumps around different applications at lightning speed. It scored admirably in benchmark testing, clocking a single-core score of 4403 and a multi-core score of 33335 on Geekbench 3. On PCMark 10, it scored a 6692, which was better than 92% of all results. It scored highest in essentials and digital content creation and slightly lower in productivity.</p><p> When I connected a hard drive to one of the fast USB ports, games loaded up with impressive efficiency. The Aurora R11 was able to handle pretty much anything I threw at it.</p><p> Boot times are fast, and it jumps around different applications at lightning speed.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Played-most-games-on-the-highest-settings"><a href="#Gaming-Played-most-games-on-the-highest-settings" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: Played most games on the highest settings"></a><strong>Gaming: Played most games on the highest settings</strong></h2><p> Although the rig I tested is a lower level Alienware Aurora R11 model, this is by no means a lower level gaming desktop. I would say it’s an upper-to-mid range, as it deftly handled most games on the highest level settings. The first game I tested was<a href="https://www.liveabout.com/destiny-2-cheat-codes-4158004"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> , not the most graphically intensive game but no slouch either, and it can definitely lag on some machines during intense action sequences. With the vsync cap set at 60, I turned_Destiny 2_ up to its highest setting, and it ran at a solid 60 FPS throughout.</p><p> Next, I ran_Far Cry 5_ , and the R11 rose to the occasion again. The R11 handled_Far Cry 5’s_ internal benchmark and maintained lag-free gaming on the ultra settings (staying at least at 60 FPS). In fact, during the internal benchmark on ultra, it ran an average of 98 FPS, with a low of 72 and a high of 115.</p><p> The R11 handled fighting games with ease. I tested_Tekken 7_ on Ultra, and it ran it consistently at 58 to 59 FPS. I also decided to give_A Total War Saga: Troy_ a try too. This ran on ultra settings with no issue at all, even in the largest battles. Zooming in and out was smooth and fast, and the game ran absolutely flawlessly.</p><p> There was only one game,<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> , where I saw the slightest bit of strain on the R11 on the highest settings. I noticed a bit of slow rendering, and the fan speed really kicked up. Even still, there was no stuttering or lagging, and_Deliverance_ is notorious for not being particularly well optimized.</p><p> The R11 has its moments—I did notice that the fans ramped at times, and I noticed a bit more warm air coming from the system on a few occasions. Of course, there are bound to be some games out there that could push the R11 to its limits, but nothing seemed to stop this beast during any game I threw at it.</p><p> The R11 handled Far Cry 5’s internal benchmark, and it maintained lag-free gaming on the ultra settings.</p><h2 id="Productivity-Free-optional-keyboard-and-optical-mouse"><a href="#Productivity-Free-optional-keyboard-and-optical-mouse" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Free optional keyboard and optical mouse"></a><strong>Productivity: Free optional keyboard and optical mouse</strong></h2><p> The Aurora R11 is designed as a gaming PC, but you could absolutely use it for work. Since this PC has ample processing power and gaming-grade graphics, you could also use it for photo or video editing. The R11 includes a free keyboard and optical mouse, but you have to specifically indicate that you want those free options. Otherwise, you’ll just get the tower and power cord.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137216/26400" target="_top" id="2137216">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137216" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137216/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-7-1-surround-sound"><a href="#Audio-7-1-surround-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: 7.1 surround sound"></a><strong>Audio: 7.1 surround sound</strong></h2><p> The R11 has a number of options for audio sources, including ports for connecting a microphone, headphones, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-surround-sound-1846802" >surround sound speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

For $20 added to the price, you can upgrade to the Killer AX1650 (2x2) 802.11ax Wireless Card and get Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 capability.</p><p> The model I tested had the baseline Wi-Fi adapter without Wi-Fi 6, but still worked exceptionally well. In my home, my Wi-Fi speed maxes out at 400 Mbps. The R11 clocked a Wi-Fi speed of 320 Mbps, according to Ookla.</p><p> As long as you have a good router, the R11 will hold a great connection for gaming. I often have trouble with 5G networks in my house, but this adapter was rock solid, and I could maintain a stable 5G connection. Of course, you can also choose to hardwire and connect an Ethernet cable if you prefer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sCKseoBNmM15udE4RMrggTlWuBs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-5-6b37b663752e4eada4c8832152dd9882.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Software-Alienware-Command-Center"><a href="#Software-Alienware-Command-Center" class="headerlink" title="Software: Alienware Command Center"></a><strong>Software: Alienware Command Center</strong></h2><p> Like most gaming PCs, the R11 runs on Windows 10 Home. You can opt for additional software like Microsoft Office and McAfee antivirus protection while you’re customizing the PC during purchase.</p><p> The R11 also includes Alienware Command Center, which is one of the more useful applications. This proprietary app allows you to tune and create custom profiles for different games and programs. You can create special light settings for the tower, view your temperature history, adjust thermal settings for your fan or liquid cooling, customize audio tuning settings, set up power schedules, and more. Gamers can also view overclock settings for their GPU.</p><p> Another application, Alienware Mobile Connect, lets you connect your PC to your mobile device. You can do things like a text from the application, make calls, access images and contacts, and mirror your screen.</p><h2 id="Cooling-Air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling"><a href="#Cooling-Air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling" class="headerlink" title="Cooling: Air cooling vs. liquid cooling"></a><strong>Cooling: Air cooling vs. liquid cooling</strong></h2><p> The R11 comes in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >air cooled <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-cooling-832445" >liquid cooled <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> configurations. I tested an air-cooled configuration. There’s a fan in the front that sucks air into the PC, and then there’s larger venting along the top and sides that helps push the air through the PC to cool down the processors. The fans are strategically placed for the optimal airflow, with a fan on the top that helps promote air circulation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UQDwEbTk5WBApmQhcAofsrxJmAs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-6-5d0cca33ca56479e8f9f7cbe8202ac1a.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Upgradability-A-latch-system"><a href="#Upgradability-A-latch-system" class="headerlink" title="Upgradability: A latch system"></a><strong>Upgradability: A latch system</strong></h2><p> The R11 is not quite as easy to open as a chassis with an easy-remove glass side panel, but it still offers easy upgradability. The tower opens with a lock and latch system that releases the side panel. Once you remove the side panel, you can move the power supply out of the way so you can better access the internals.</p><p> This is a system that will be easy to keep up to date. There’s room inside of the R11 for additional drives, and the configuration I tested supports up two more 2.5-inch hard drives with the spaces empty and ready to go.</p><p> If you opt for the liquid-cooled unit, your upgrading options could be more limited simply because it might be more difficult to find compatible parts. That is, unless you plan to stick with Alienware gear over the long run.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jzGkH061o51TFghPHwP5n6bmE34=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-3-7a87edbb11b041818dbf44880e3c79fd.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad"><a href="#Price-Not-bad" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad"></a><strong>Price: Not bad</strong></h2><p> The price of your R11 is going to vary widely depending on how much you want to put into it. You can get an Aurora R11 for under a grand though. The R11 configuration I tested retails for $1410, but it was $30 less because the test model included the lower tier chassis (without RGB lighting in the word “Alienware” along the side). For the lower tier models, the prices are reasonable, and you can upgrade the PC later on.</p><p> For the higher tier models, the prices are steep. The highest tier R11 costs just under five grand. For that price, many people would be happier building their own rig.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139118/17108" target="_top" id="2139118">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139118" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139118/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alienware-Aurora-R11-vs-HP-Omen-Obelisk"><a href="#Alienware-Aurora-R11-vs-HP-Omen-Obelisk" class="headerlink" title="Alienware Aurora R11 vs. HP Omen Obelisk"></a><strong>Alienware Aurora R11 vs. HP Omen Obelisk</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hp-omen-obelisk-review-5072832" >HP Omen Obelisk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a clean design, with sharp lines and angles and a glass side panel.

The lowest tier Obelisk includes the AMD Ryzen5 3500 Processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 (6 GB), while the lowest tier Aurora includes a 10th gen<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >Intel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> i5 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER 4GB GDDR6.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses roughly the same design as many of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, and it didn’t give the absolute best results either. Nonetheless, it’s still going to be the best choice for a really large segment of buyers out there simply because of how aggressively its priced.</p><p> If you are living inside of a large metropolitan area, you likely don’t need the best possible antenna to pick up the channels being broadcast to you over the air. Furthermore, I didn’t see that big of a difference in performance as price increased. Unless you step it all the way up to a much larger, much more expensive solution, the difference in performance is probably not worth it, which is why the 1byone is an easy recommendation. Let’s see how it performed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FEdsHVNn7IxwxXsSkRT0jxmmRuQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_02-d797d473ec154becbab8a3023cff8b53.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Vanilla"><a href="#Design-Vanilla" class="headerlink" title="Design: Vanilla"></a><strong>Design: Vanilla</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses a flat rectangular design similar to other powered indoor antennas on the market. The 13.25 x 9.25 inch antenna surface is roughly in line with most of the other products I looked at in this category, the only real difference being that the 1byone has a much more rigid surface.</p><p> Being a powered antenna, the 1byone uses an external amplifier to boost the signal. This box contains a coaxial input attached via the included 16.5ft cable, and has a power input, which can be supplied by the TV itself if it can support USB power. Otherwise, 1byone includes a USB power adapter.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fairly-intuitive"><a href="#Setup-Fairly-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fairly intuitive"></a><strong>Setup: Fairly intuitive</strong></h2><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas. Simply attach the 16.5ft coaxial cable to the external amplifier, connect the power to a USB power source, and then attach the coaxial cable from the amplifier to your TV.</p><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Good-enough-for-most"><a href="#Performance-Good-enough-for-most" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Good enough for most"></a><strong>Performance: Good enough for most</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna didn’t have the best performance of the antennas we’ve tested, falling somewhere in the middle of the pack. In my channel acquisition test, I averaged 59 channels across all the tests performed. This compares to the worst performing antenna at just 47, and the best at 76.</p><p> This should be more than suitable for most people living within a city in relatively close proximity to the source of the TV signal. As for those living further, your mileage may vary.</p><h2 id="Range-Middle-of-the-road"><a href="#Range-Middle-of-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Range: Middle of the road"></a><strong>Range: Middle of the road</strong></h2><p> 1byone makes no specific promises about the range of their antenna, although they do cite users having positive experiences from as far as 48 miles away in their customer testimonials. Given how many factors impact the effective range, I think it is somewhat wise not to make any promises. Nonetheless, this is clearly a device that will be best suited for people living in or near major metropolitan areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6y-ITpY8n7xf8BteMqdJjYm-paU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_05-178a02351af040cc89c86169b88a6de2.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983588">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983588">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983588%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983588/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-great-deal"><a href="#Price-A-great-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great deal"></a><strong>Price: A great deal</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna costs just $25, making it the least expensive option out of the antennas I tested. It picked up all the major channels that I would actually watch, and didn’t have any issues with the signal. So from my perspective, why would I pay more? I think buyers would probably be best served by seeing if an antenna like this works for them. If you discover you need something more substantial, feel free to move on to a pricier option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135374/19272" target="_top" id="2135374">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135374" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135374/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna"><a href="#1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna"></a><strong>1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Another popular manufacturer is Mohu, and the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna offers a simpler, non-amplified solution that only loses out on a hair of performance versus the 1byone. I preferred the build quality of the Mohu Leaf, if only marginally, and like the simplicity of not needing additional wires and boxes hanging out of my TV.</p><p> At the end of the day though, the 1byone performs better and costs less money, so it’s not the easiest argument to make.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The overall best value.</strong></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna offers the best value out of all the indoor antennas that we tested. If you can get the performance you need from the 1byone, it’s the antenna to buy. I wouldn’t consider other options unless you’ve already ruled out this one.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Amplified Digital HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  1byone</li><li>Price  $25.00</li><li>Release Date  December 2014</li><li>Weight  9.3 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  13.6 x 2 x 10.4 in.</li><li>Color  White</li><li>Powered  Yes</li><li>Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor  Indoor</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-epic-tiktok-gamers-top-10-influencers-for-2024/"><u>[New] Epic TikTok Gamers Top 10 Influencers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-historical-insights-at-your-fingertips-top-10-for-students-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Historical Insights at Your Fingertips – Top 10 for Students for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-unveiling-youtubes-full-rotation-streaming-potential-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling YouTube’s Full-Rotation Streaming Potential for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/boosting-interaction-potential-including-friends-to-messenger/"><u>Boosting Interaction Potential: Including Friends to Messenger</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blue-screen-error.techidaily.com/1723199746265-comprehensive-solutions-to-the-bsod-error-0xc00lete-on-windows-10-and-8-get-your-pc-back-online/"><u>Comprehensive Solutions to the BSOD (Error 0xC00lete) on Windows 10 and 8: Get Your PC Back Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/easy-tutorial-how-to-get-and-run-kodi-on-windows-10-operating-system/"><u>Easy Tutorial: How to Get and Run Kodi on Windows 10 Operating System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/expert-evaluation-of-the-galaxy-ford-f-150-rc-monster-truck-lineup/"><u>Expert Evaluation of the Galaxy Ford F-150 RC Monster Truck Lineup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/irksome-iphone-x-problems-heres-how-you-can-solve-them/"><u>Irksome iPhone X Problems?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Shopping for an inexpensive but high-quality 4K TV under $1,000 that won’t take up too much space? The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) ticks all those boxes. Despite its low price, this Roku TV is rich with features that rival more expensive options.</p><p> We tested the TCL 50S425 and were impressed by the ease of setup, picture quality, and user-friendliness of this<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8IJD6mxL-mHDn0MMWWRd5yZERlc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_04-bbd6d026c9ec48df9f12c934b7def674.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward"><a href="#Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lightweight and straightforward"></a><strong>Design: Lightweight and straightforward</strong></h2><p> Smart TVs range in size, typically starting from 32 inches and reaching all the way up to 85 inches and beyond. If you can’t accommodate or don’t want a really large television, the TCL 50-inch Roku TV offers a decent middle ground that will appeal to shoppers who want an apartment or dorm-friendly TV without sacrificing quality.</p><p> In appearance, the TCL 50S425 doesn’t reinvent the wheel. It’s black, rectangular, and slim. It comes with the option of wall-mounting or setting it up on a media console or other surface with the enclosed stand. With the legs attached, the set measures 44 inches wide, 28 inches tall, and 8 inches deep and weighs only 23.6 pounds. While the screen is categorized in the 50-inch class the size of the display is 49.5 inches on a diagonal. This lack of bulky bezels surrounding the screen contributes to the slim profile of this TV.</p><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV.</p><p> The Roku remote complements the streamlined design of the screen. In the style of other Roku remotes, it’s a compact and almost weightless wand-like infrared device with a simple and straightforward layout. We found it easy to hold in one hand and easily access all 20 buttons without having to make any grip adjustments. There are also a handful of shortcut buttons for quick access to Netflix, Hulu, the Roku Channel, and ESPN. As long as you point it directly toward the TV, you shouldn’t have any problems with remote performance, but we did notice an occasional lag here or there when the remote seemed to hang and then perform multiple actions in quick succession.</p><p> There are some unfortunate design quirks. The remote’s directional buttons are quite loud. They don’t require a hard press to activate, but they make an audible clicking sound. This is slightly jarring since the other buttons are nearly silent when pressed. Another drawback is the LED status indicator located in the bottom center of the display. By default this light is always on. You can turn this indicator off, but it will continue to blink and flash during other operations, which we sometimes found distracting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cT13RJhaMjC05v7eMym3vtM8M0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_05-70fc23cf6c2b4a13ac9d46f9372010ef.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Up and running in minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Up and running in minutes</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 50-inch TCL Roku TV is a breeze. We opted to forego mounting the television, but the user manual indicates that this model is compatible with a VESA 200 x 200 wall mount with M6 x 12mm screws.</p><p> As directed, we placed the monitor face down on a plush surface and attached the two stand legs using the four MS x 25mm screws. After situating the television on a shelf, we plugged the unit into a wall outlet using the enclosed AC power cord. Once the TV was plugged in, it powered on immediately and displayed the guided setup process. These steps were very straightforward and included first setting a language preference, a network connection, and activating the device. The other critical step with setup involves either signing up for or logging into an existing Roku account.</p><p> Since we already had a Roku account, all of our previously selected channels and apps downloaded to the TV, which just took a few minutes, and then we were free to begin exploring. The amount of additional setup is pretty minimal. By default, you’ll see an HDR notification when you’re viewing HDR-enabled content, but you can turn this off from the settings panel if you like.</p><p> Additionally, if you plan to use a set-top cable box or antenna, the user manual offers straightforward instructions for doing so. You also have the option of enabling the Smart TV experience when you use antenna TV mode. This setting uses automatic content recognition (ACR) to make viewing recommendations based on what you view through your antenna or connected HDMI devices.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking</strong></h2><p> One of the biggest draws of a 4K TV is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which offers four times the resolution quality of a standard high definition TV. This pixel resolution is also commonly referred to as Ultra HD (UHD). This Roku TV also comes with HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which is commonly bundled with 4K resolution in the newest smart TVs.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR improves image quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by intensifying the contrast between white and black areas on the screen while achieving a solid balance, so nothing looks too dark or too bright. It also broadens the palette of available colors, especially in combination with Wide Color Gamut (WCG).</p><p> One thing we noticed right out of the gate is how vivid 4K content looks. To test the 4K image quality, we started by exploring the 4K Spotlight content. This section includes links to 4K movies, TV, and videos. We found a couple of nature-themed 4K videos on YouTube and were really impressed with what we saw. A video touring Zion National Park looked almost 3D and we practically felt like we were there. The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> Apart from 4K nature videos, we also browsed 4K movies and TV shows through the Amazon Prime app. We found the same appealing mix of crisp picture quality, vibrant colors, and contrast. Even standard high definition shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, and Prime looked quite good on screen. Though it’s hard to say if there’s a considerable difference, TCL is eager to boast about the power of their 4K Creative Pro upscaling feature which renders regular HD content into 4K-like quality. The bottom line is that HD content looks great across the board, upscaled or not.</p><p> The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> With the handy multi-purpose asterisk button you can alter a number of display settings, and you can access this options menu in the middle of viewing content. Adjusting picture settings doesn’t require exiting an app or pausing whatever you’re watching, which lets you make adjustments and immediately see the result. You can add more vibrancy and contrast to whatever you’re watching, or enable modes like Movie when you’re viewing a film in the evening or with the lights dimmed.</p><p> You can control everything from backlighting to brightness, contrast, and dynamic contrast. This last setting is particularly relevant to HDR content because it helps balance the light and dark settings on your screen so that there’s no excess in either direction. The online user manual does a fine job of explaining some of the advanced picture settings, and even just toggling through the menu on the TV brings up a description of what you’re changing.</p><p> Regular picture mode and the predefined 4K HDR picture settings were on point, which made viewing right out of the box extremely easy and pleasant. We were also pleased by the picture quality from all angles. Getting too close or too far out to the right or left did reveal some shadows and distortion, but only at fairly extreme angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Lv4B9e6LaJSHW7NSl-Braa2vnmc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_03-b8155781e440420aa0c6c2bf19f9fe6a.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130891/7443" target="_top" id="2130891">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130891" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130891/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding</strong></h2><p> While the TCL Roku TV offers impressive picture quality, the sound is less noteworthy. The two built-in 8-watt speakers offer decent volume levels, but there’s no advanced audio settings menu in this model. You do have control over aspects like sound mode and volume mode. The default sound mode is “normal,” which is appropriate for everyday viewing. But you can also select options for higher treble, more bass, movie, or music mode. As for volume modes, you can either turn on leveling, to balance the contrast between lows and highs in audio, or enable night mode, which sets a threshold for how high the volume can go.</p><p> We did notice some issues with what sounded like crackling and extreme lows and highs in dialog and music, though we were able to smooth these issues out by tweaking a few settings.</p><p> In our testing experience in a small room, the internal speakers were more than adequate without the need for additional speakers. If you do want another layer of dimension to your audio, you might consider opting for the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-speakers-and-home-theater-1846770" >wireless speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> designed specifically for Roku TV sets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oA3AbTZysdVWZbOWuuVGOa56_8c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_02-04183ae8dcd44b778b4da0e7706d5df2.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983553%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983553/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive and streamlined"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive and streamlined</strong></h2><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV and a big part of the equation is the operating system. The TCL 50S425 operates on Roku OS 9.1, and it’s extremely user-friendly. Updates are automatic so there’s no manual effort required on your part, and the interface is laid out in a clear and uncomplicated manner.</p><p> The Home screen features all of your apps, which you can arrange and delete with the click of the asterisk button. All the other menus are easy to identify as well. There’s a search page, a streaming channels section, and the settings menu. This clean and straightforward layout may not be the most sophisticated, but it’s easy to use and simplicity is the beauty of this system.</p><p> While the remote doesn’t come with a built-in speaker, the free Roku app does offer a voice-assistant feature. It’s best when completing a general search for a show or actor or for launching a particular app. If you have a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa enabled device, this Roku TV will support them, and they offer a generally better experience than using the Roku app voice remote function.</p><h2 id="Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great bargain on a budget"></a><strong>Price: A great bargain on a budget</strong></h2><p> If you don’t want to spend a fortune on a 4K TV, but you want to get as much value as possible, the TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a compelling option. It retails for $350, which situates it in the growing and competitive class of 4K TVs under $500. In the TCL 4-Series alone you have several other models to consider that all share the same specifications except for size. The larger 55-inch TCL Roku TV retails for just $30 more than the 50-inch version and features a larger screen size of 54.6 inches. It may not seem considerable, but if you’re limited with space, the extra width and height (five and two inches, respectively) can actually feel like a pretty massive difference. And if you opt for a smaller display and a lower price tag, the 43-inch TCL Roku TV retails for about $280, but you’re sacrificing 7 inches of display.</p><h2 id="TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition"><a href="#TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition" class="headerlink" title="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"></a><strong>TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</strong></h2><p> The TCL 50-inch Roku TV is not without external competitors either. The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition retails for about $100 more and runs on the Fire OS, which stands toe-to-toe with the Roku platform with access to over 500,000 shows and movies. The Toshiba Fire TV comes with an Alexa-enabled remote, an edge for shoppers who want the ease of a voice assistant built right into the remote. But the Roku TV supports both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as voice control through the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> While the Toshiba TV is in the 55-inch class, the screen size is actually the same as the Roku TV. The former, however is visibly taller, wider, and bulkier. The Toshiba Fire TV does havea slight advantage when it comes to audio quality. The sound can get quite loud and full-bodied, thanks to two 10-watt speakers and DTS Studio Sound&#x2F;DTS TruSurround. On the other hand, the picture quality may not be as impressive as the Roku TV, which really doesn’t require a lot of tweaking to enjoy. And if you’re a fan of the simple Roku interface, you may find the Fire OS dashboard to be a bit cluttered.</p><p> Browse our other recommendations on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >best smart TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and best TVs under $500.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/toshiba-55lf711u20-55-inch-fire-tv-edition-review-4772221" >Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A budget-friendly 4K TV that offers impressive picture and overall value.</strong></p><p> The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a smart 4K TV that possesses many merits: an appealing price point, excellent 4K HDR picture quality, a size profile that won’t overwhelm small rooms or apartments, and an easy-to-use interface that requires little fuss. You may find better 4K picture and audio quality in a higher-end model, but this TV offers a welcome smart TV upgrade at a price that won’t empty your pockets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a

Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender takes on a different kind of philosophy. That’s reflected in the boosted price, certainly, but also the capabilities: this is the first Wi-Fi 6 extender on the market.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new standard that not only allows for faster maximum speeds than previous generations but also better accommodates the increasing pile of wireless devices that we have around our homes and connecting at any given time—from phones to laptops and smart home gadgets. Newer smartphones and laptops are implementing support for the standard, and new Wi-Fi routers are being released to supply those benefits.</p><p> If you don’t already have one of those new Wi-Fi 6 routers, should you spend extra for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 to futureproof your setup? Here’s what I think after testing the device for several days across everyday web usage, media streaming, playing online games, and more.</p><h2 id="Design-Pretty-awkward"><a href="#Design-Pretty-awkward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty awkward"></a><strong>Design: Pretty awkward</strong></h2><p> The Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is not only the largest and heaviest Wi-Fi extender I’ve tested at 10 inches tall and nearly two pounds, but it’s also one of the oddest-looking. It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward. Also, the little plastic feet don’t do a great job of supporting the weight, making it a bit wobbly on a flat surface.</p><p> With very large sides, the front is really just a small panel with light-up LED indicators showing connectivity details and which Ethernet ports are in use. There’s also a small WPS button beneath the LED panel for easy connectivity with a router. On the wider back panel are the four wired<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for plugging in devices such as game consoles and computers, as well as a USB 3.0 port, DC power port, and the power button itself.</p><p> It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130887/7443" target="_top" id="2130887">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130887" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130887/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Avoid the app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Avoid the app</strong></h2><p> The setup options for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 are the same as with Netgear’s other extenders—even those without Wi-Fi 6 support. You’ll begin with the extender plugged in near your router. If your router supports<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you can pair the extender with it easily by following the process listed in the included booklet, which is as simple as pressing a button on the router and then doing the same on the extender.</p><p> If that’s not an option, or you’d rather follow a step-by-step process with prompts, then you can set it up using either a mobile (iOS or Android) app or a web browser on your computer.</p><p> The mobile app has been unreliable in my experience with other Netgear extenders, but it was much worse when setting up the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The app repeatedly could not connect with the created mesh network on the extender during setup, and I had to factory reset the device multiple times to start again.</p><p> Over and over, the setup process wouldn’t complete… and then it finally did. I ran into similar issues with the other Netgear extenders, in which setup processes didn’t work as expected on the first or second time, but this was a much longer and more arduous ordeal. Finally, however, I got the Nighthawk AX8 up and running. From there, you’ll need to find a new location for the extender—roughly halfway between the router and your Wi-Fi dead zone is ideal, but play around with positioning if you’re not getting the results you seek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xru8JLL_UOk3sXBYpbrOyAl-ihc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_02-b120eab8816746338c53e4eb1cfc62d6.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Smooth-sailing"><a href="#Connectivity-Smooth-sailing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Smooth sailing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p> Once through the hassle of setup, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender really did deliver strong performance. I tested the connection in my office, which reliably sees reduced 5GHz reception from my router due to obstructions in between, and saw a noticeable boost in both reception and speed.</p><p> In one test, I registered a 5GHz speed of 246Mbps with the extender, which was the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen anywhere in my house using that older, TP-Link router. Given that, I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The router isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, but I still saw higher top-end speeds than ever before.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender also performed pretty well in distance testing. In another instance, I registered a 5GHz download speed of 87Mbps with my office, and then measured the speeds from my backyard at approximate distance intervals from the extender.</p><p> I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8.</p><p> That 5GHz signal dropped down to 77Mbps at 25 feet, 74Mbps at 50 feet, and 56Mbps at 25 feet—still pretty speedy from the farthest edge of my property. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz signal started at just 42Mbps at that moment in my office, and dropped to 30Mbps at 25 feet, 28Mbps at 50 feet, and 26Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Given the high max speeds, it wasn’t surprising to see strong gaming performance, as well. While playing Rocket League, I saw smooth gameplay across the wired Ethernet connection as well as both wireless networks, with a ping as low as 33 via the wired connection. The wireless ping was only a few points higher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rtnI3hSe9qP5qFqjhu1LRxe7qYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_03-19da5fea4d0349ce984f52a11493d337.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> As a Wi-Fi mesh extender, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 will automatically replicate the SSID of your router’s existing Wi-Fi networks and seamlessly keep you connected whenever you’re in range of either. That’s true even with non-Netgear routers and those without Wi-Fi 6 support, and it’s a huge benefit over some cheaper extenders that don’t keep the same network info intact across devices.</p><p> It’s billed as an “8-stream” device, so it should be able to handle several simultaneous media streams at once, with a billed max speed of 4.8Gbps on the 5GHz band and 1.2Gbps on the 2.4GHz band.

That’s definitely on the higher end for an extender.</p><p> Should you really spend that much on an extender? If you don’t already have a new Wi-Fi 6 router, then probably not. You might see higher peaks of speed as I did, but rather than trying to mix and match old and new tech, you’re probably better off investing in a new Wi-Fi mesh system that can cover the entire house. Netgear’s Orbi is a favorite, as is Google’s similar Nest Wi-Fi system.</p><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)</strong></h2><p> Both of these Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi extenders will set you back $200 or more, and the key difference between them—aside from design—is the Wi-Fi 6 compatibility of the Nighthawk AX8. The Nighthawk X6S (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Range-Extender-EX8000/dp/B074F3M2W8/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846125%7Cn35b11b2c61b54fa1a2d951691d1a61ed04%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have that, but it does deliver excellent 5GHz range and has four Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices. The Nighthawk AX8 is more future-proof as a result, but at a greater cost that becomes increasingly difficult to justify the higher, it climbs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Only for early adopters with Wi-Fi 6 routers and devices.</strong></p><p> If you’ve already bought a Wi-Fi 6 router and need a little help extending your signal into further corners of your home and&#x2F;or property, then the Nighthawk AX 8 (EAX 80) is the extender you’ll want. But if you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead. Spending more than $200 on an extender doesn’t make much sense unless you’re adding it to a top-of-the-line system—and don’t mind the significant investment.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk EAX80 AX6000 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  EAX80</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  10 x 7.75 x 4.2 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Ports  4x Ethernet, 1x USB</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-chuckle-trail-your-guide-to-hilarious-online-stars/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Chuckle Trail Your Guide to Hilarious Online Stars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-amplify-your-online-presence-with-google-meets-aesthetic-tools/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How to Amplify Your Online Presence with Google Meet's Aesthetic Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-curate-engaging-content-with-top-igtv-editor-tools/"><u>[Updated] Curate Engaging Content with Top IGTV Editor Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-ideal-choices-apps-that-convert-photos-to-films/"><u>[Updated] Ideal Choices Apps That Convert Photos to Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/acceleration-materielle-pour-le-codage-video-avec-handbrake-sans-utiliser-cuda-solutions-pratiques/"><u>Accélération Matérielle Pour Le Codage Vidéo Avec HandBrake Sans Utiliser CUDA : Solutions Pratiques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/explore-the-world-of-streaming-with-roku-express-top-reviews-on-quality-and-savings/"><u>Explore the World of Streaming with Roku Express - Top Reviews on Quality & Savings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-11-best-pokemon-go-spoofers-for-gps-spoofing-on-apple-iphone-6s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 11 Best Pokemon Go Spoofers for GPS Spoofing on Apple iPhone 6s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/invest-in-peace-of-mind-with-smaller-devices-how-miniscule-trackers-can-deliver-maximum-security-for-belongings/"><u>Invest in Peace of Mind with Smaller Devices - How Miniscule Trackers Can Deliver Maximum Security for Belongings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-verdict-on-lenovo-tab-4-a-cost-effective-android-tablet-with-trade-offs-explored/"><u>The Verdict on Lenovo Tab 4: A Cost-Effective Android Tablet with Trade-Offs Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/top-reviews-for-razers-portable-wi-fi-solution-the-portal/"><u>Top Reviews for Razer's Portable Wi-Fi Solution - The Portal</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A good webcam has HD resolution, quality sound, and is easy to use. We tested the Logitech C615 Webcam to see whether it can deliver what you need to start recording your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/86PZ5XCiq91ihr7-8UNmM5io9pY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_4_Final_Horiz-bad356a5002b4156859dca672e8a8eb4.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Design-Flexible-foldable-design"><a href="#Design-Flexible-foldable-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Flexible, foldable design"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>Flexible, foldable design</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 is a compact webcam. The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you’re prone to losing things, this may be an issue.</p><p> The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.</p><p> The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.</p><p> The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jgQ_lVlvzgmXFPpBg5nEd6pgV_c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_12_Final_Horiz-e97c48d3af6842eb88775a9d703ce2b6.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles</strong></h2><p> The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.</p><p> Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.</p><p> The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.</p><p> The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bko9Uk1HIIMt9aNgtBf9ATCy0AA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_14_Final_Horiz-4f1b9fe91b8c4229b17dbbe6afb81b8c.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic"><a href="#Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic"></a><strong>Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic</strong></h2><p> We used both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test the performance of the C615. It was very easy to position the camera exactly the way we wanted it, though the USB cable occasionally gave us problems. We’d swivel the camera and then the pull of the USB cable would turn the whole base so the camera pointed back at the same spot where it started.</p><p> When we used Skype to make calls everything worked great. The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone. From 10 feet away, we heard only a small amount of echo in the call. We also tried using the camera mic with video game noise in the background. The camera clearly caught our voices and downplayed the background noise, helping us focus on what we wanted to hear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C2UBXNFmxG8nA0udy1IprMH4LBA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_9_Final_Horiz-1af52951f8704af9b76d7dd1ec9744a9.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531882">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531882">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531882%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531882/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive HD camera"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive HD camera</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 costs $70 MSRP, but you can find it for about half that cost.

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> If you use your laptop for playing games or running high-performance apps, then you’ve probably seen it get very warm and kick on its potentially loud internal fans. However, the built-in fans can only do so much to dissipate the immense heat built within, try as they might. That’s where laptop cooling pads come in, blasting additional cool air into your laptop to help take down the internal and external temperatures.</p><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.</p><p> Kootek’s Laptop Cooling Pad isn’t the cheapest option around, nor is it the most premium—but it’s effective and sells for a reasonable price, and is large enough to accommodate larger laptops with 17-inch displays. A clunky height adjustment system is the main drawback, but it doesn’t stop the Kootek pad from working as expected.</p><h2 id="Design-Clunky-but-it-works"><a href="#Design-Clunky-but-it-works" class="headerlink" title="Design: Clunky, but it works"></a>Design: Clunky, but it works</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a larger unit, measuring nearly 15 inches wide, 11.8 inches tall, and about 1.4 inches thick, with a weight of 2.6 pounds. It’s heavier and bulkier than the lightweight TopMate C302 Cooling Pad, for example, and feels more durable as a result.</p><p> It’s built for laptops with screens between 12 and 17 inches diagonal, with a wide metal grate on the surface to help dissipate heat as the five fans blow onto your laptop. Most of the rest of the build is plastic. Each fan has red LED lighting for an added glow to the pad.</p><p> The height adjustment system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution.</p><p> Two flip-up, padded stoppers at the bottom of the surface help keep your laptop in place even when you have the pad angled, thanks to the height adjustment system. Granted, that system is easily my least favorite part of this cooling pad.</p><p> Essentially, there’s a loose metal bar hanging from the main unit of the cooling pad, and you’ll slot that into one of six ridges on the bottom stand to prop it up. The system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution. It works and it provides finer-grain height adjustment levels, but it feels like a clunky solution for a tech accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Uuby879oWyaUH6_3WN7ZssAF-g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_04-73dc23f85de34fa087b21b21461f9f74.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> There are two buttons at the back of the pad: One button controls the large, central fan (4.72 inches), while the other controls the four smaller fans (2.76 inches each). I’m not sure why you would choose to use only some fans at any given time, since they’re all quiet, but the option is there if you want it. You’ll also find two USB-A ports, meaning this cooling pad functions as a hub for plugging additional accessories into your laptop.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Very-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Very-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Very straightforward"></a>Setup Process: Very straightforward</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad doesn’t require any software or its own power unit to function. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the height as desired, and then plug the built-in USB cable into your laptop to power it on. As mentioned, you can control the fans using the buttons at the back of the pad, and the USB ports can be used for additional accessories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A5iJ3c7mD8guT4DKXitqb3wlp6I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_03-9ec8e6afd494441f8ae20c38ae1fadbb.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-Cool-and-quiet"><a href="#Performance-Cool-and-quiet" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Cool and quiet"></a>Performance: Cool and quiet</h2><p> I tested the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , featuring an Intel Core i7-9750H processor with 16GB RAM, along with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB). It’s a solidly powerful gaming laptop, and I put it to the test with a couple of popular games as well as a graphics benchmark test.</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid impact in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite.</p><p> I recorded the internal temperature using NZXT’s CAM app and the external temperature with a infrared thermometer, first with the laptop by itself. After it cooled down, I tested again with the cooling pad equipped the whole time.</p><p> In racing game Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade put up an internal processor temperature of 184 degrees Fahrenheit and external temperature of 117 degrees, but peaked at 169 degrees internal and 107 degrees external with the Kootek pad equipped. The average frame rate was nearly identical between tests, with no significant difference from the use of the cooling pad.</p><p> Meanwhile, I saw a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees when playing Fortnite, along with an external temperature of 118 degrees. With the cooling pad equipped, I saw a slightly lower internal peak of 192 degrees, although it mostly hovered in the 160 to 170-degree range during testing. The external peak with the Kootek pad was 106 degrees. Curiously, I saw the exact same numbers with the Heaven graphics benchmark test with and without the cooling pad: 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees external.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ppFnQ9kEpjbEV9cYbHzLRI5j-j8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_05-4a4d5ee065a94c3e984ae0c96f4916d8.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid effort in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite, although the cheaper, dual-fan TopMate C302 cooling pad saw slightly better overall results. Your experience may vary depending on your laptop of choice, however. All the while, the Kootek pad stayed pretty quiet in stark contrast to the Razer Blade’s own very loud internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1516072">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1516072">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1516072%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1516072/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Entirely-reasonable"><a href="#Price-Entirely-reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Entirely reasonable"></a>Price: Entirely reasonable</h2><p> At $26 from Amazon, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.

It’s designed for laptops up to 15 inches in size and isn’t quite as thick or heavy, but it gets the job done with effective cooling and straightforward design. Kootek’s pad offers an additional USB port for accessories, though, and allows for more height variance than the TopMate’s basic pop-out feet.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good all-around option.</strong></p><p> A clunky design makes the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad a bit awkward in use, but ultimately it does a solid job of cooling hot laptops and accommodating larger-sized devices. The extra USB ports are handy, especially for port-limited laptops, and the price is reasonable.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134503/19576" target="_top" id="2134503">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134503" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134503/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  Kootek</li><li>MPN  LCP05</li><li>Price  $35.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2018</li><li>Weight  2.91 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15 x 11.8 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Ports  USB-A x2</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-frosty-yet-warm-choosing-the-best-winter-backdrops/"><u>[New] In 2024, Frosty Yet Warm Choosing the Best Winter Backdrops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-professional-framing-methods-using-letterbox-and-black-bar-on-social-networks/"><u>[New] Professional Framing Methods Using Letterbox & Black Bar on Social Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/complete-guide-for-recovering-pictures-files-on-itel-s23-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>Complete guide for recovering pictures files on Itel S23.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/demystifying-whatsapps-sound-message-exchange-for-2024/"><u>Demystifying WhatsApp's Sound Message Exchange for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/drone-dynamics-a-thorough-gopro-karma-examination/"><u>Drone Dynamics A Thorough GoPro Karma Examination</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/exploring-the-samsung-galaxy-a51-5g-top-reviews-and-why-its-a-steal-for-enthusiasts/"><u>Exploring the Samsung Galaxy A51 5G: Top Reviews & Why It's a Steal for Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/get-rich-in-sound-without-spending-big-activbuds-reviewed/"><u>Get Rich in Sound without Spending Big: ActivBuds Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/harness-free-advanced-raw-photo-processing-tools-in-darktable-perfect-compatibility-with-macos-and-linux-systems/"><u>Harness Free, Advanced RAW Photo Processing Tools in Darktable – Perfect Compatibility with macOS and Linux Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-distorted-or-no-audio-from-youtube-on-your-windows-11-pc/"><u>How to Fix Distorted or No Audio From YouTube on Your Windows 11 PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/how-to-successfully-advertise-on-your-blog-through-buyselladscom-for-better-profits/"><u>How to Successfully Advertise on Your Blog Through BuySellAds.com for Better Profits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-breakdown-of-moto-g-power-features-high-efficiency-and-extensive-battery-life/"><u>The Ultimate Breakdown of Moto G Power Features: High Efficiency & Extensive Battery Life</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Fossil has a reputation for making cool watches, both of the traditional and smart variety, and Fossil Sport is no exception. The question is, does it work as well as it looks?</p><h2 id="Design-Classy-looks-quality-controls"><a href="#Design-Classy-looks-quality-controls" class="headerlink" title="Design: Classy looks, quality controls"></a><strong>Design: Classy looks, quality controls</strong></h2><p> The Fossil Sport is one slick looking watch, and it’s impressively customizable. There are a number of different colors to choose from, as well as varying colors of extra bands you can buy as accessories. I tested the Smoke Black model and appreciated its understated and elegant appearance. If that’s not your thing, you can go crazy and make the watch as gaudy and unique as you like.</p><p> The included silicone band feels durable and high quality, as does the aluminum upper half of the case. The lower half of the watch is made of nylon to reduce weight, making this smartwatch only 0.88 ounces. The Fossil Sport is charged using a magnetic,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/qi-wireless-charging-4151894" >wireless charging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> pad that snaps onto the rear of the watch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/09nYIY5js64r3HdZV05shTtw6aI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fossil-Sport-Smart-Watch-3-596e9d29b0634b1a9abfa429e619733e.jpg"                      alt="Fossil Sport Smartwatch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The Fossil Sport is controlled using both a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-touchscreen-4144770" >touchscreen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and three dedicated buttons. The central button features a rotating dial that’s great for scrolling through menus and notifications. The other two can be programmed as shortcuts to access different functions. It’s water-resistant down to 5 ATM, or 164 feet, though it’s not a diving watch.</p><p> The Fossil Sport is one slick looking watch, and it’s impressively customizable.</p><h2 id="Setup-process-Streamlined-with-lots-of-prompts"><a href="#Setup-process-Streamlined-with-lots-of-prompts" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Streamlined with lots of prompts"></a><strong>Setup process: Streamlined with lots of prompts</strong></h2><p> The Google Wear OS setup experience is decently streamlined, though be prepared to sit through plenty of prompts for the various permissions needed to fully utilize the capabilities of the Fossil Sport. Once you’ve got the Wear OS app installed on your phone, it will guide you through the pairing and setup processes. When you’re through with this initial setup, the other aspects of the watch (like Google Fit, apps,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412" >Bluetooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> headphone connections, etc.) require their own separate setup processes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DdOVg5yJzQTRZs3QPo_qPoBT7mA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fossil-Sport-Smart-Watch-4-653a372a18904e089de460ed88380344.jpg"                      alt="Fossil Sport Smartwatch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Comfort-Highly-adjustable"><a href="#Comfort-Highly-adjustable" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Highly adjustable"></a><strong>Comfort: Highly adjustable</strong></h2><p> I appreciated that Fossil included a watch band large enough to fit my extra-large 9-inch wrists with room to spare. I found it comfortable to wear all day long; its lightweight prevented it from being overly burdensome on my wrist.</p><h2 id="Performance-Accurate-stats"><a href="#Performance-Accurate-stats" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Accurate stats"></a><strong>Performance: Accurate stats</strong></h2><p> I was impressed by the accuracy of the Fossil Sport’s heart rate sensor and its other fitness tracking features. It read my correct heart rate right off the bat, which is something other smartwatches have failed to do due to my chunky wrists. The GPS and pedometer accurately kept track of my progress on walks and other activities, and these statistics are handled and gamified to some degree through Google Fit. This makes detailed statistics readily available on your phone, though it doesn’t provide quite as much detail and analysis as other fitness tracking software.</p><p> The 1.2-inch 390 PPI AMOLED display is wonderfully crisp, clear, and bright enough to see even in strong sunlight. It’s so pretty to look at with deep blacks and bright colors that I found myself occasionally glancing at the watch just to enjoy this startlingly nice screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118315/7443" target="_top" id="2118315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118315/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-24-hour-power"><a href="#Battery-24-hour-power" class="headerlink" title="Battery: 24-hour power"></a><strong>Battery: 24-hour power</strong></h2><p> I found that I was easily able to get through a day or two without having to recharge the Fossil Sport. Its 24-hour battery claim is accurate under average daily use conditions. Once you do run the battery down, the watch switches into a battery saver mode where only the time is displayed.

On one hand, WearOS supports a range of devices, which means the Fossil Sport isn’t dependent upon a closed ecosystem. On the other hand, I had some issues with the compatibility of WearOS apps on Fossil Sport.</p><p> On the upside, the interface is great to use, highly responsive, and almost lag-free. Pretty much everything is customizable in terms of both form and function. You also get Google Pay, which enjoys relatively wide support, and there’s a large library of WearOS compatible apps.</p><p> However, my issue lies with the fact that just because an app runs on WearOS, this doesn’t mean it will run flawlessly on any WearOS device. I was able to download a really cool barometric altimeter, but with other apps, I experienced more mixed results. For example, Spotify installed just fine on my Fossil Sport, but it was very buggy.</p><p> The Fossil Sport does feature 4GB of storage space and can connect to Bluetooth headphones, so it’s possible to download music and listen offline. However, due to my issues getting Spotify to function, this capability is somewhat hobbled.</p><p> Just because an app runs on WearOS, this doesn’t mean it will run flawlessly on any WearOS device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury" target="_top" id="2120863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-An-excellent-value"><a href="#Price-An-excellent-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An excellent value"></a><strong>Price: An excellent value</strong></h2><p> Since launch, the MSRP of the Vivoactive 3 Music has plummeted from $275 to just $99, making it a genuine bargain.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition packs all the functionality of an Amazon Fire TV streaming device right into its chassis. This 55-inch LED smart TV combines affordability with Alexa, Amazon Prime content, and access to over 500,000 episodes across your favorite streaming platforms. We thoroughly tested the Toshiba’s picture quality, display settings, and the Fire OS interface and usability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pCLBMqSK1Hi3ePW2jzUkDycA2IU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_04-f1f62a55ea504fc9aa98fc9e14527ba7.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room"><a href="#Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room" class="headerlink" title="Design: Best for a bigger room"></a><strong>Design: Best for a bigger room</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55-inch Fire TV is not a small device. While it only weighs 31.3 pounds with the stand (though the stand itself weighs less than a pound), it’s both tall and wide enough to make moving and installing it a two-person job. The TV’s dimensions with the stand are 27.8 inches tall, 44.6 inches wide, and 10.7 inches deep, and the screen size (on a diagonal) measures at 49.5 inches.</p><p> There’s no wall mount included in the box, but there are four standard VESA mounting holes on the back of the unit for safe and easy installation. In a smaller space, wall-mounting this television might not be a bad idea. Even in the relatively modestly-sized room where we tested the TV, it nearly completely took up the entire shelf where we placed it and a broad swath of the wall behind it. This TV is not particularly thin and actually tends to be a bit bulky in the very back of the unit, and the stand also adds width. The legs splay out and require a wide, long surface to accommodate them.</p><p> An attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500.</p><p> The other important component is the Alexa-enabled remote, which is small, lightweight, and contains a circular dial with directional controls and play&#x2F;pause functionality. You also have the benefit of summoning Alexa with the touch of the speaker button, which is intuitively placed at the top of the remote (though we often accidentally hit it when we were trying to push the Home button, which is right below it).</p><p> The buttons are clearly laid out on the remote, and it’s convenient to have volume and mute controls in addition to a shortcut button to antenna channels. There are also some shortcut buttons as well: Prime Video, Nextflix, HBO, and Vue.</p><p> There are some downsides to the remote’s overall quality. Unlike other Fire TV remotes that create a completely smooth and seamless effect on the back, this remote is a lot more traditional, with a tab for pulling off the battery cover. It makes an unfortunate creaking noise almost every time you push a button, and while it never fell off the noise was distracting and contributed to the plastic and flimsy feel of the remote.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bohXBE5CBPeYtI5seooxoQhyzkY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_02-781cfad0cacf41878e3ffb24afd56c6e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> There is a little setup required out of the box, whether you wall mount it or attach the stand. We chose the latter and found the instructions to be straightforward. Each leg requires both a longer 35 mm screw to help create a secure attachment to the bottom of the TV and two 10 mm screws that secure the legs to the back of the unit.</p><p> Installing the legs isn’t complicated, but it can be awkward because you need to place the TV screen-side down on a soft or cushioned surface. It helps to have a bit of space to do this either on a sofa or a clean, carpeted area, and maybe a helping hand to situate the TV wherever you plan to put it.</p><p> Once the legs were in place, we placed the TV on a table and plugged in the power cord. The TV powered on immediately and we were prompted to press the play&#x2F;pause button on the remote to begin setup.</p><p> We were guided through a quick process of connecting to Wi-Fi, signing in with Amazon account credentials, and registering the TV to our account. While you can enjoy this television without an existing Amazon account, you will have to create one in order to complete setup and gain access to all apps. The whole setup only takes a few moments, though, and we were on the Home screen of the Fire OS interface before we knew it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Gg5qCbaSxBZF2n4hLJ-UWMjX7vk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_05-ea81ea03abde49c3856c921f1321d024.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129739/7443" target="_top" id="2129739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130890/7443" target="_top" id="2130890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking</strong></h2><p> While setting up the TV was very fast and took only a few minutes, we did have to spend some time adjusting the picture settings. Unfortunately, this is not something the online user manual provides much insight about.</p><p> We headed straight for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> content on Amazon Prime and played a number of movies and TV series. What we found was that it consistently took about a minute for the picture to kick into Ultra HD<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The default standard picture settings yielded an incredibly dark picture with too much contrast. The reds were very exaggerated and the low-light scenes, especially scenes at night, were very difficult to see.</p><p> Accessing the HDR picture settings is not exactly intuitive. Long-pressing the Home button on the remote brings up a shortcut menu and that’s where we were able to access HDR picture settings. Picture settings can be found under Display and Sounds in the main Settings menu, but there’s only a blanket setting for all app and video content. Settings that work for regular HD content, which was the majority of the content we viewed, were inadequate for HDR content.</p><p>Ultra HD HDR content shines in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> For the best Ultra HD HDR picture quality, we found that changing to movie mode instead of standard smoothed out the saturation a bit. For good measure we also turned off Dynamic Backlight, HDR Tone Mapping, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mpeg-file-2622031" >MPEG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Noise Reduction. This helped the Ultra HD HDR content shine in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> Another image quality issue we encountered was<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macroblocking-and-pixelation-1847333" >video artifacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which are glitches and distortions in picture quality. This can be a result of data loss due to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-media-file-compression-1847431" >media file compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , signal interference, or other factors. It was a particular problem when viewing HD Amazon Prime content, but we also observed it in Hulu content. Turning off Edge Enhancer and Motion Processing from the picture settings menu helped eliminate artifacting when streaming media, but it didn’t resolve this issue when we watched live TV via Hulu. There we got long sequences of pixelated content and macroblocking, where the image appeared broken up into blocky chunks.</p><p> We did switch the picture mode to Game when playing an HD game, but didn’t notice a significant difference in quality. The picture was already quite vibrant and clear without making this switch, and the only discernible difference was that Game mode made color tones a bit more saturated. Presumably the panel is deactivating some post-processing to improve input lag, but we didn’t notice a significant difference in either quality or latency.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KHIDIBlAKmxc6ZGa6AocjOoGEpY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_06-1fe0d195f3844b89822833f4c0f4d69e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 is outfitted with two 10-watt speakers enhanced with DTS Studio Sound. According to DTS, this technology smooths transitions, volume, and bass levels while changing channels or sources.</p><p> Audio quality isn’t spectacular but is generally consistent and clear across media. The volume can get quite loud and fill the room, which is good if you don’t plan to add additional home-entertainment speakers. There are also bass, treble, and balancing settings that help cater to your individual EQ preferences.</p><p> Like the suite of picture settings, there are sound modes to achieve the most appropriate audio experience based on what media you’re consuming. These modes include Standard, Movie, Music, Clear Voice, and a user-defined Custom mode. Movie mode seemed to work out best for our preferences, yielding neither an extremely tinny nor bassy sound.</p><p> There are also the DTS TruSurround and TruVolume controls—TruSurround is on by default and functions to create a richer and more amplified sound, but TruVolume is off. Flipping it on helped control and even out fluctuations in sound, which was a problem we encountered streaming some content on Netflix and Hulu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FdoBEgX__hYz6EgBVAeh47z5pyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_03-39faf55a89c8450cbddcb795f2f0fcc8.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1492813">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1492813">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1492813%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1492813/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered"><a href="#Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered" class="headerlink" title="Software: Easy to use but cluttered"></a><strong>Software: Easy to use but cluttered</strong></h2><p> This Toshiba TV runs on Fire OS, which is easy to interact with but has some quirks. As an Amazon product it feature Amazon Prime content first and foremost, which may be convenient for Prime subscribers but is slightly less so if you’re primarily looking for Netflix or Hulu content. We found that the remote occasionally lagged if we didn’t point it directly toward the TV sensors, and virtually any time we loaded and exited apps or spun up Prime content. Loading time varied from a few seconds to upwards of ten. There’s also an odd bug when exiting out of the Hulu app. It routinely took about five seconds before the system got us back to the Home dashboard, before which it would take us to the Hulu home page.</p><p> The Fire OS Home menu is the spot that features recent apps, downloaded apps, as well as suggested content based on viewing activity. This arrangement is clear enough, but wading through options becomes more confusing based on the other menu pages, which include Movies, Live, TV Shows, Apps, and Your Videos. Much of the content you’ll see across these pages is duplicated, so overlap is a part of the user experience, which means clutter and confusion. Once you get a handle on this arrangement it’s easy enough to wade through, but a more streamlined layout would be welcome.</p><p> One way to avoid what can feel like a labored navigation experience is to use Alexa. But that doesn’t always make the process any easier. When testing commands like “Tune to ABC” in Hulu Live, we encountered a bunch of error messages. Searching the whole system for content through Alexa can make your life easier. Doing so brings up a menu of choices, displaying content availability on various streaming platforms as well as whether content is free or available for rent or purchase. Once you make a decision, Alexa takes you directly to the content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/grEHZxJFIUgX8TcaLouLrOiXNUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_07-a8725babe7be46ad86619a83a5ca972a.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience"><a href="#Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience"></a><strong>Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience</strong></h2><p> At around $450, the Toshiba Fire TV Edition is an attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500. It’s considerably lighter than other smart TVs that skew more toward the $1,000 price range and offers solid sound and picture quality, plus instant access to myriad streaming apps and services.</p><p> If you’re thinking about cutting the cord with a streaming media player and purchasing a new TV, this Toshiba TV is a solid option that won’t require you to pay through the nose. It’s even more appealing if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber and if you like the idea of a built-in voice assistant.</p><h2 id="Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV"><a href="#Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV" class="headerlink" title="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch   Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV"></a><strong>Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch</strong>   <strong>Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a happy medium between features&#x2F;functionality, saving space, and affordability, the TCL 50S425 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Roku TV may be a worthy option. This smart 4K television retails for under $400 and blends 4K Ultra HD quality with HDR, resulting in vivid and exceptional picture quality for the price. The Roku TV is not only cheaper than the Toshiba Fire TV Edition, but it’s also 1 pound lighter despite being both slightly taller, wider, and deeper than the Toshiba 55LF711U20.</p><p> The other benefit of the Roku TV is the interface, which is more streamlined than the Fire OS dashboard. If you’re not overly enthusiastic about Alexa or Google Assistant, you could choose to integrate either down the line with the Roku—since it’s compatible with both—or forego them altogether. Alternatively, the Roku app also offers a handy mobile remote and voice control. If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber you’ll still have easy access to that content through the Prime app, though it won’t be as prominent, which is actually a boon.</p><p> Consider some of our other picks for the best cheap TVs or the best TVs under $500.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A capable smart TV for active Amazon Prime users.</strong></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition is a big, bold, affordable 4K smart TV that’s ideal for Amazon Prime subscribers and Alexa users. It offers solid sound and picture quality, especially once you’ve chosen the configuration that work best for your viewing preferences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139117/17108" target="_top" id="2139117">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139117" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139117/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tcl-50s425-50-inch-roku-tv-2019-review-4772224" >TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/insignia-ns-43df710na19-fire-tv-edition-review-4770716" >Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-xbr49x900f-49-inch-4k-ultra-hd-smart-led-tv-review-4796665" >Sony XBR49X900F 49-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</li><li>Product Brand  Toshiba</li><li>MPN  55LF711U20</li><li>Price  $449.99</li><li>Weight  31.3 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  27.8 x 44.6 x 10.7 in.</li><li>Platform  Fire OS</li><li>Screen Size  49.5 inches</li><li>Screen Resolution  3840 x 2160 pixels (4K)</li><li>Ports:  HDMI x 3, USB, Ethernet, A&#x2F;C power, Headphone, Analog Audio, Digital Audio</li><li>Formats Supported  HD, 4K UHD, HDR</li><li>Speakers  Two 10-watt DTS Studio</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-go-viral-on-youtube-with-minimal-effort/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Go Viral on YouTube with Minimal Effort</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-craftsmanship-redefined-leading-photo-frame-apps/"><u>2024 Approved Craftsmanship Redefined Leading Photo Frame Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instagrams-most-impactful-personalities-top-25-edition/"><u>2024 Approved Instagram's Most Impactful Personalities Top 25 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-implementing-effective-transitions-on-inshot/"><u>2024 Approved Step-by-Step Implementing Effective Transitions on Inshot</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/dell-inspiron-3671-computer-system-analysis-an-overview-of-a-solid-midrange-desktop/"><u>Dell Inspiron 3671 Computer System Analysis: An Overview of a Solid Midrange Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-the-pinnacle-of-smart-wear-2024s-finest-glasses-reviewed/"><u>Discover the Pinnacle of Smart-Wear: 2024'S Finest Glasses Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/from-shot-to-spectacle-pro-tips-for-transformative-photographic-edits-for-2024/"><u>From Shot to Spectacle Pro Tips for Transformative Photographic Edits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/ultimate-acer-discounts-maximizing-savings-in-novemberdecember-2024/"><u>Ultimate Acer Discounts: Maximizing Savings in November/December 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-performance-of-logitechs-premium-hd-webcam-c920-a-full-review/"><u>Unveiling the Performance of Logitech's Premium HD Webcam, C920 – A Full Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-best-free-video-compression-tools-for-ios-devices/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Best Free Video Compression Tools for iOS Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/why-the-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-reigns-supreme-on-google-play/"><u>Why the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra Reigns Supreme on Google Play</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you travel with any regularity or use your devices considerably outside of the home or an office, then it’s well worth having a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-portable-laptop-battery-4050506" >portable laptop battery charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> around for when your phone runs low or you need a little more work time before your laptop shuts off. ZMI’s PowerPack 20000 is one of the best all-around options on the market today, providing a sizable cell with speedy charging across phones, tablets, laptops, portable game systems, and more, plus a slim design and great price.</p><p> I tested ZMI’s PowerPack 20000 time and again over more than a week across multiple devices, measuring the charging speeds and comparing it to other similar power banks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jITowxAWHBUo5WF3Y-XI6lKQNQE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/zmi-05-02d76c869b864ef0abddfe824cfbf53a.jpg"                      alt="ZMI PowerPack 20000"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Design-Small-but-powerful"><a href="#Design-Small-but-powerful" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but powerful"></a><strong>Design: Small but powerful</strong></h2><p> The ZMI PowerPack 20000’s size is easily one of its biggest selling points. While it is a little heavy at 14.3 ounces, this power bank is the approximate width and height of a large smartphone, measuring up very closely to the size of my Apple iPhone 11 Pro at 6.3 x 3.2 inches (HWD). Of course, the 0.8-inch thickness is quite a bit larger than any phone today, but unlike most laptop-friendly charging banks, ZMI’s can still fit into a pocket or handbag with ease.</p><p> It’s smooth navy blue aluminum on the outside with a black plastic strip running along the entire frame, with one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Power Delivery 2.0 port and two USB-A ports on one end. Nearby on the upper right side frame is a power button and four small lights that indicate how much power the bank is currently holding.</p><p> Unlike most laptop-friendly charging banks, ZMI’s can still fit into a pocket or handbag with ease.</p><p> The button also serves another very handy purpose: press it twice in a row and you’ll enable USB devices to be used by a connected computer. I plugged the ZMI PowerPack 20000 into a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/huawei-matebook-x-pro-signature-edition-review-4845244" >Huawei MateBook X Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> laptop and then plugged a USB mouse into the power bank, pressed the button twice, and then was able to use the mouse on the laptop. That’s incredibly helpful for slim, premium laptops that have very few ports.</p><p> This power bank doesn’t have an AC port for full-sized power plugs, as some competing power banks do, but it also costs less and is much smaller than those alternatives typically are.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vaINPELrwcWnOZDsX1ztKkCouww=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/zmi-03-1530f666df824f6281040c2ae3285eb2-2e7956941b91403aa888795a7e5e2e33.jpeg"                      alt="ZMI PowerPack 20000"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-does-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-does-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy does it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy does it</strong></h2><p> There’s not much to the setup process here. Using the included USB-C to USB-C cable, simply plug one end into the power bank and the other into an AC adapter that you have handy—like one for a laptop, tablet, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Once the four lights on the side are fully illuminated, then the battery pack is fully charged. Simply plug in devices using their respective cables to charge them using the power within the ZMI PowerPack 20000.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137223/26400" target="_top" id="2137223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137223/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-It-keeps-going"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-It-keeps-going" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: It keeps going"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: It keeps going</strong></h2><p> The ZMI PowerPack 20000 has a hearty 20,000mAh cell within, and it charged my devices quickly without fully depleting the brick. I charged a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2019-review-4770116" >2019 MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (13-inch) laptop from 0 percent to 100 percent in just 1 hour, 53 minutes using the ZMI PowerPack 20000’s USB-C PD port, with an effective charging rate of 42.92W (14.8Vx2.9A). When the charging process was complete, the PowerPack still had one light illuminated, indicating that there was still a little bit of battery life remaining.</p><p> In a separate test, I had the ZMI PowerPack 20000 power the MacBook Pro as it played a locally-downloaded movie on loop at full brightness. With the PowerPack plugged in, the laptop maintained its 100 percent charge for 8 hours, 4 minutes before the power bank ran out of juice.</p><p> The PowerPack 20000 also charged a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-4685690" >Samsung Galaxy S10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone from nothing to 100 percent in 1 hour, 47 minutes using the USB-C PD port, with four lights still remaining on the power bank. This sizable power bank should be able to charge an average smartphone a few times over, not to mention a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Those are both stellar benefits, plus the fabric-lined exterior gives it a distinctive allure. That said, Mophie’s pack sells for $200, and we’d only recommend it if you must have the AC power outlet for charging a power-hungry laptop. If the ZMI PowerPack 20000 will meet your charging needs, however, it’s a much better bargain.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fantastic portable laptop battery charger for nearly everyone.</strong></p><p> It’s honestly difficult to find anything to complain about with the ZMI PowerPack 20000. It’s powerful and does a great job of charging laptops and phones, it has enough capacity to handle those tasks with ease, it’s compact and well-designed, and the price is fantastic. It’s half the size of the giant Anker power brick that I’ve brought on my last two international trips and can handle all of the same tasks. In other words,<em>this</em> is the power brick I’m bringing on my next trip.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  PowerPack 20000</li><li>Product Brand  ZMI</li><li>SKU  X001ESM8MV</li><li>Price  $70.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.3 x 3.2 x 0.8 in.</li><li>Warranty  18 months</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C, 2x USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-extending-your-content-a-detailed-youtube-video-upload-manual/"><u>[New] Extending Your Content A Detailed YouTube Video Upload Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-sage-select-best-general-knowledge-channels/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Sage Select Best General Knowledge Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-zd-soft-screen-recorder-key-features-and-review/"><u>[Updated] ZD Soft Screen Recorder Key Features and Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-best-apps-for-screen-mirroring-honor-magic-5-pro-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 8 Best Apps for Screen Mirroring Honor Magic 5 Pro PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-sports-viewership-in-the-digital-age/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Sports Viewership in the Digital Age</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-read-this-guide-to-find-a-reliable-alternative-to-fake-gps-on-samsung-galaxy-xcover-7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Read This Guide to Find a Reliable Alternative to Fake GPS On Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/inside-the-world-of-the-serious-reader-unveiling-the-powerful-features-of-the-kobo-forma/"><u>Inside the World of the Serious Reader: Unveiling the Powerful Features of the Kobo Forma</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/investing-in-new-battery-life-apples-phones-and-pods/"><u>Investing in New Battery Life: Apple's Phones & Pods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/maximizing-reach-tweeting-on-facebook/"><u>Maximizing Reach Tweeting on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/navigating-the-features-of-the-razer-blade-pro-17-a-top-gaming-laptop-compacted/"><u>Navigating the Features of the Razer Blade Pro 17 - A Top Gaming Laptop Compacted</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-toon-up-your-photos-top-mobile-apps-for-cartoon-style-editing-for-2024/"><u>New Toon Up Your Photos Top Mobile Apps for Cartoon-Style Editing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/optimal-gpu-choices-4k-editing-and-rendering-for-2024/"><u>Optimal GPU Choices 4K Editing & Rendering for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/pioneers-ultimate-mounting-system-review/"><u>Pioneer's Ultimate Mounting System Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-review-of-fujitsus-high-performance-scansnap-ix1600-for-office-use/"><u>The Ultimate Review of Fujitsu's High-Performance ScanSnap iX1600 for Office Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/transform-your-photos-effortlessly-premium-features-of-the-free-lightzone-editor-on-windows-mac-and-linux/"><u>Transform Your Photos Effortlessly: Premium Features of the Free LightZone Editor on Windows, Mac & Linux</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/ultimate-evaluation-of-the-ps4-pro-achieving-4k-visuals/"><u>Ultimate Evaluation of the PS4 Pro: Achieving 4K Visuals</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner. Its body composition tool is a particular highlight.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 looks and feels lovely to use. Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome. It saves you from needing to grab your phone so often, right down to the Samsung Wallet support and even a remote camera tool.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, BuzzFeed, PCMag, T3, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends all recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has over 3,900 ratings on Amazon, with 88% of those rating the watch either five or four stars. The overall average rating is 4.5 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >Garmin Vivoactive 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Khj7pEOVbeqTsspKEl_3pIItgxc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GarminVivoactive53-573f048663d44d2eb0fbb8614fc6a669.jpg" >Garmin Vivoactive 5. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >$267 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> More affordable than most Garmin watches, the Garmin Vivoactive 5 offers all the key features while not looking too sporty.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135351/19272" target="_top" id="2135351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> A Garmin Watch is the dream for active types, but they often cost a lot and rarely look great when fine dining. The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.

It’s easily the sturdiest flash drive we’ve evaluated.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> Topping our list of USB flash drives is the SanDisk Extreme PRO. Its 256GB storage space is impressive, and its read and write (data transfer) speeds reach 420Mbps and 380Mbps, respectively.</p><p> To put these speeds in perspective, imagine you had 2GB of data. At these speeds, it can transfer the files to a computer in about 40 seconds and transfer them back in about 42 seconds.</p><p> For comparison, our budget recommendation (read speed of 100Mbps and write speeds of up to 30–35Mbps) would take about two minutes and 40 seconds to transfer the files to a computer and nearly nine minutes to transfer them back.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-read-and-write-speeds-2640236" >An Explanation of Read and Write Speeds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In addition to its generous storage space and speed, we thoroughly enjoyed its weighty and sturdy feel. Holding it in hand feels just right, with an even weight distribution throughout. An included keychain hole also helps you attach it to whatever you need (hello, backpack pocket liner!).</p><p> While the SanDisk Extreme PRO is a fantastic device, it’s important to note a few design quirks. The retractable plug is convenient feature, but it can sometimes feel stuck and isn’t as smooth as we’d like.</p><p> However, a simple adjustment in how you push the plug can quickly resolve this. Push your thumb against the retractable plug’s side rather than in the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VzaKxOdaMFqGHZPPFjBAiNP-s3Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_SanDisk256GBExtremePROUSB3.2SolidStateFlashDrive-3517c6beda944a6eb980e748d694c880.jpg"                      alt="SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Solid State Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> This minor inconvenience is unlikely to be a major issue unless you use it constantly.</p><p> Another feature we appreciate about the Extreme PRO is the included RescuePRO Deluxe data recovery suite, which makes it very easy to recover accidentally deleted files. Separately, SanDisk SecureAccess software keeps your information secure using 128-bit encryption.</p><p> Overall, we see the SanDisk Extreme PRO as a true jack of all trades, even compared to other higher-end options on the market.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong>  The SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO has received glowing reviews, with Wirecutter recommending it in its USB flash drive guide.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong>  Most buyers have nothing but good things to say about the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO on Amazon. As of now, it has generated more than 4,400 ratings, with an average of 4.7 stars.</p><h2 id="Also-Great"><a href="#Also-Great" class="headerlink" title="Also Great"></a>Also Great</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX" >Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth 1TB USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5O9M2DYXMkvqQNuAQPz7t89shUM=/fit-in/1500x579/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Corsair-Flash-Survivor-Stealth-1TB-6f7c1dd8417447ca852c5fbfb2d65b95.jpg" >Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth 1TB USB flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX" >$131 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/data-storage/cmfss3b-1tb/flash-survivor-stealth-1tb-usb-3-0-flash-drive-cmfss3b-1tb" >View on Corsair.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Military-grade aluminum housing</li><li>200-meter waterproof rating</li><li>Monstrous storage capacity (1TB)</li><li>Great for high-quality audio formats like WAV or FLAC</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Quite large (8 inches long)</li><li>Not the most intuitive keychain loop</li></ul><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth earns our second pick thanks to its adventurous spirit, waterproof rating, and rugged military-style aluminum casing.

To put that into perspective, it equates to a whopping 209,000 5MB files, enough for a music library that even the most famous international DJ would need, so you’re well covered. Other storage options (128GB and 256GB) exist as well.</p><p> When it comes to usability, this Flash Survivor Stealth USB simply rocks. Hold it and enjoy a sturdy aluminum construction with center ridges for a comfortable grip.</p><p> It’s also waterproof up to 200 meters, though we were in no hurry to submerge it with valuable data inside and find out if it was true.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We also appreciate how the Flash Survivor Stealth USB opens. Grab the keychain loop, unscrew it counterclockwise, and pull it out, revealing the slimmer casing underneath and the USB port. To put it back, pop it in and rotate the end clockwise until it becomes tight (like a bottle cap).</p><p> If there’s one thing we’d improve about the design, it’s the keychain loop. Its integration into the design means the hole is relatively small and difficult to spot. It may also make it hard to clip onto larger key rings. However, keychain loops aren’t crucial for USB flash drives, so we’ll pardon Corsair for this minor usability issue.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth has seen stellar ratings on sites like TweakTown.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> If you look at the Amazon reviews, most Corsair users are pretty ecstatic. Its average 4.5-star rating covers everything from the unit’s durability to its 1TB storage capacity.</p><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xOv4XG2m0FAXv2xnn1MqZOuo9o8=/fit-in/1500x1368/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kingston-DataTraveler70-be3585b8673644689895fb96814e0e4c.jpg" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 USB-C flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >$20 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid storage capacity (256GB)</li><li>Moderate reading and writing speeds</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Plastic end caps can be tricky to remove with moist hands</li><li>Good, but not excellent, build quality</li><li>Not as many Amazon ratings as our other recs</li></ul><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is a budget performer, boasting an impressive 256GB storage capacity (great for the price!) and decent, though not exceptional, build quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is one of our favorite budget USB drive options. It’s straightforward with few frills, allowing you to easily store your favorite playlist. It boasts a modest read speed of up to 100Mbps and writes speeds of up to 30–35 Mbps.</p><p> A transfer rate of up to 100Mbps means that a large 1GB file can be transferred in less than 10 seconds straight from your Kingston to your device. It performs pretty well with no lag time in opening files, unlike other comparably priced options we’ve tested that missed the mark.</p><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is pretty basic in terms of design. Shaped like a traditional pen drive, it features a plastic end cap and a slight concave ridge for a sturdy grip. Be sure to have dry hands when pulling off the end cap, as it can get stuck.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We recommend this USB flash drive for anyone seeking a quick and affordable solution. However, if you require the highest storage capacity and fastest read and write speeds possible for a massive music library, stick with the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Solid State Flash Drive.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Sites like Tom’s Hardware have covered the Kingston DataTraveler, highlighting its dominance over generic Amazon USB flash drives.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> Priced at less than $20 and boasting close to 200 ratings with an average of 4.1 stars (as of this writing), Amazon review feedback is generally positive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R0gpCBnrQFQJSKrMdtsqJ1CtoK4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/usb_drives-3e49e18e98274da79cb37d1e49fa99a2.jpg"                      alt="The SanDisk Extreme PRO, Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth, and Kingston DataTraveler 70 USB drives."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135368/19272" target="_top" id="2135368">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135368" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135368/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><h2 id="How-We-Test"><a href="#How-We-Test" class="headerlink" title="How We Test"></a>How We Test</h2><p> Our recommendations come from three well-known USB drive manufacturers: Kingston, Corsair, and SanDisk. Each excels in different areas.</p><p> To earn passing marks, all of our reviewed USB flash drives must shine in all of the following areas:</p><ul><li>Storage capacity</li><li>Read and write speeds</li><li>Build quality and cost</li></ul><p> Naturally, storage capacity is a matter of preference. An international music DJ may require one terabyte, while a hobbyist may be satisfied with 250GB.</p><p> We also prioritized the highest read and write speeds for our top two picks. Read speed refers to how fast the USB drive can retrieve data from a device (phone, laptop, etc.), whereas write speed refers to how quickly data can be stored.</p><p> If you rarely transfer large files, try to aim for at least 50Mbps read speeds and 20Mbps write speeds. For more regular, large file transfers, we recommend no less than 100Mbps read speeds and 50Mbps write speeds.</p><p> Don’t skimp on build quality either, with a preference toward rugged constructions like the military-grade aluminum Corsair that can withstand plenty of punishment in your bag or purse.</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> When you’re searching for the best overall USB flash drive, it all boils down to individual preferences.</p><p> How many files are you looking to save? For example, if you only have a modest photo library (say, 20,000 5MB photos), then a 100GB USB drive will suffice. Anything more than that, and 256GB or even 1TB options could be your best bet.</p><p> If you only care about fast transfers, try to get the fastest read and write speeds available. Aim for anything over 100 Mbps for read speed and above 30Mbps for writing speed. Remember, writing speed will almost always be slower than reading speed.</p><p> Read our <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-size-usb-flash-drive-do-i-need-2640421" >USB Drive buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><h3 id="Brands-We-Consider"><a href="#Brands-We-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Brands We Consider"></a>Brands We Consider</h3><ul><li>Aneew</li><li>Corsair</li><li>Kingston</li><li>SanDisk</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-flash-drives-for-music-2438381" >The Best USB Flash Drives to Store Music in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Should you buy an external hard drive or a USB flash drive?<br> Consider an external hard drive if you’re looking for a large amount of storage, faster transfer speeds, and don’t mind a large form factor and higher cost. A USB flash drive is the way to go for smaller amounts of data in the most portable size available (and even greater plug-and-play convenience).</li><li>Are USB flash drives good for backing up data long term?<br> Flash drives are some of the less reliable storage mediums and are designed (and best used) as temporary envelopes for data transfer. Traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are the best solution for long-term backup, providing the most data stability and capacity for the price. Or, for a faster solution at a higher price tag, consider a solid disk drive (SSD).</li><li>What’s the difference between USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB-C flash drives?<br> The USB standard a flash drive is built around will determine its potential performance, including the maximum transfer rate. For instance, the transfer ceiling for USB 3.0 is theoretically ten times higher than 2.0. Letters following a USB designation (like USB-A, USB-B, or USB-C) indicate the physical type of connection; USB-A is the familiar rectangle most associated with the standard, while USB-C is a reversible flat oval.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-tiktoks-new-wave-popular-rap-songs-to-sync-with-for-2024/"><u>[New] TikTok's New Wave Popular Rap Songs to Sync With for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-visual-storytelling-instagrams-photo-integration/"><u>[New] Visual Storytelling Instagram's Photo Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-from-sketches-to-screens-animation-via-windows-movie-maker/"><u>[Updated] From Sketches to Screens Animation via Windows Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-top-9-fb-scraper-apps-for-films/"><u>[Updated] Top 9 FB Scraper Apps for Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-the-power-of-the-lenovo-9-nook-tablet-through-our-in-depth-tutorial/"><u>Discover the Power of the Lenovo 9 Nook Tablet Through Our In-Depth Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/expert-insights-on-the-hp-chromebook-11-an-exceptional-choice-for-schoolwork-office-tasks-and-casual-browsing/"><u>Expert Insights on the HP Chromebook 11: An Exceptional Choice for Schoolwork, Office Tasks & Casual Browsing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-windows-speaker-sound-distortion-issue/"><u>How to Fix Window's Speaker Sound Distortion Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-lock-your-motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-phone-in-style-the-top-5-gesture-lock-screen-apps-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Lock Your Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) Phone in Style The Top 5 Gesture Lock Screen Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/is-the-cost-effective-hewlett-packards-amd-laptop-up-to-the-task-in-depth-review-inside/"><u>Is the Cost-Effective Hewlett-Packard's AMD Laptop Up to the Task?

The design is minimalistic almost to a fault, with a basic, white, plastic body, a few indicator LEDs, an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a sync button, and an electrical pass-through. It’s also available in a slightly larger version that costs a bit less and doesn’t come with the pass-through.</p><p> Due to the bulky nature of this powerline adapter, the pass-through is a nice touch. The version of the Powerline AV2000 that doesn’t include a pass-through is big enough to block electrical outlets above and to either side, depending on your outlet configuration, making it a bit of a pain to use in a lot of situations.</p><p> Since you can’t plug these into a power strip without suffering a massive hit to data transfer speeds, it’s really nice to have the option to plug a power strip or any other device into the pass-through. Out test unit included the pass-through, and we highly recommend spending the extra money to get the version of the hardware with this feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xx_XMhVtfwHDrdQV9zP4xFm4PkA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4141215-02-4ccab309a3564682aefbd0a48f39355f.jpg"                      alt="D-Link Powerline AV2000 Passthrough DHP-P701AV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137221/26400" target="_top" id="2137221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137221/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-special-knowledge-or-tools-required"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-special-knowledge-or-tools-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No special knowledge or tools required"></a><strong>Setup Process: No special knowledge or tools required</strong></h2><p> Setting up a wired network with a set of D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters requires absolutely no networking experience or knowledge. The setup process requires you to plug one adapter into your modem or router with an included Ethernet cable, plug the other adapter into your computer, game console, or any other device that has an Ethernet port, and then plug both adapters into power.</p><p> Setting up a wired network with a set of D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters requires absolutely no networking experience or knowledge.</p><p> Once you have the adapters plugged in, they automatically detect each other and establish a network connection. You can verify that this process is in progress by watching the LEDs on each adapter, which will light up when the device is powered on, when a network connection is established between the adapters, and when a connection is established between the adapter and the device it’s connected to via ethernet cable.</p><p> Each Powerline AV2000 adapter also includes a button that you can press to establish a secure connection. This isn’t necessary, but it’s still very easy. To get started, you push the button on one adapter for two seconds. You then have two minutes to press the corresponding button on the other adapter. The adapters will then established a secure connection using 128-bit AES encryption.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/X0oLXEoZMMDp1yHZ4thpEvAY2Sk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4141215-05-29cdfecba8e74dc9a126aff93f29b3ce.jpg"                      alt="D-Link Powerline AV2000 Passthrough DHP-P701AV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Connectivity-HomePlug-AV2-with-MIMO"><a href="#Connectivity-HomePlug-AV2-with-MIMO" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: HomePlug AV2 with MIMO"></a><strong>Connectivity: HomePlug AV2 with MIMO</strong></h2><p> D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters use the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/powerline-home-networking-and-homeplug-817720" >HomePlug AV2 specification <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so they’re nominally compatible with other AV2 devices. In practice, and when using the secure network function, they work best with other D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters.</p><p> Each Powerline AV2000 adapter also includes a button that you can press to establish a secure connection.</p><p> Since they use the HomePlug AV2 specification, these adapters are able to take advantage of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >multi-in multi-out (MIMO) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with beamforming.

It’s fairly simple and provides a few management and testing tools. You can update the firmware of your adapters to the latest version, pinpoint a malfunctioning system, change the encryption key used by your devices, or provide custom names for each adapter.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135357/19272" target="_top" id="2135357">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135357" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135357/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-On-the-expensive-side-of-the-scale"><a href="#Price-On-the-expensive-side-of-the-scale" class="headerlink" title="Price: On the expensive side of the scale"></a><strong>Price: On the expensive side of the scale</strong></h2><p> The D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters are priced on the upper end of the scale for similarly equipped adapters.

The pass-through version that we tested has an MSRP of $160 and usually sells for around $110.</p><p> The typical street price for these adapters is pretty close to the competition, but the MSRP is significantly more expensive. Since some competitors, like Extollo, make adapters that are even faster than these, it’s likely that you’re primarily paying for the brand name rather than better performance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770526">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770526">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770526%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770526/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Beats-most-of-the-competition-but-doesn’t-come-out-on-top"><a href="#Competition-Beats-most-of-the-competition-but-doesn’t-come-out-on-top" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Beats most of the competition, but doesn’t come out on top"></a><strong>Competition: Beats most of the competition, but doesn’t come out on top</strong></h2><p> The D-Link Powerline AV2000 adapters beat most competitors in terms of sheer performance, and the slightly higher price tag is mostly justified by high transfer speeds and reliable connections. The main exception is the Extollo LANSocket 1500, which was a bit faster in our tests, and has an MSRP of just $90.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/extollo-lansocket-1500-review-4778158" >Extollo LANSocket 1500 Powerline Adapter Kit Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Compared to the Netgear PowerLINE 2000, with an MSRP of $85, the D-Link Powerline AV2000 comes out on top in terms of transfer speed. However, the difference might not be enough to justify the price gap, especially if you have a home internet connection that’s on the slower side.</p><p> The TP-Link AV2000 is another competitor that has a theoretical top speed of 2Gbps, but falls short of that in real-world testing.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black is the result of multiple refinements since the original model, and through its many iterations, it’s become one of the most popular and high-tech action cameras on the market. From insanely advanced image stabilization to live streaming capabilities, the HERO7 Black is built for more than just action shots.</p><p> We recently got our hands on this tiny powerhouse to see if the improvements in software and video quality are worth its asking price.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Design-Classic-action-camera-design"><a href="#Design-Classic-action-camera-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Classic action camera design"></a><strong>Design: Classic action camera design</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black measures in at 2.4 x 1.3 x 1.8 inches, so it’s super compact and almost a cube. The device is all black with a very nice rubber casing around the unit that makes it feel soft to the touch.</p><p> The design is very minimal. The power button is located on the right side of the camera and a record button at the top. On the side, there is a door that hides the USB and HDMI ports, and another door on the bottom that conceals the battery and MicroSD port. The front of the camera has a small screen that displays the current settings.</p><p> All these doors protect the camera’s ports from the elements and give it a tough outer shell that’s rugged enough to survive rough falls and submersion in up to 33 feet of water. The HERO7 Black is a great travel camera that can be taken on exotic trips where water adventures and rough terrain are a part of your itinerary.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black we noticed that the body of the device becomes very hot when used for long periods of time. We tested it for a few hours nonstop and noticed it was still very warm even when it was not recording. This can be a big concern if the device is used for long recordings in hot temperatures.</p><h2 id="Display-Bright-and-visible"><a href="#Display-Bright-and-visible" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright and visible"></a><strong>Display: Bright and visible</strong></h2><p> The back of the GoPro HERO7 Black has a two-inch touchscreen that is bright and easy to read. While testing the camera, we were able to navigate through the menus with the single touch of a finger, which are intuitive and easy to adjust. Simply tap to select.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Updates out of the box"></a><strong>Setup: Updates out of the box</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black did not have much battery life out of the box. Once we powered it on, we set the date, time, and location. It then prompted us to update the software, which required a blank memory card and fully-charged battery to complete.</p><p> The HERO7 Black has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth compatibility, which makes it easy to pair with a smartphone that has the GoPro App downloaded. We were able to make the camera discoverable in the Preferences menu, and then the app could automatically scan and connect to the camera when it was opened.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134218/18498" target="_top" id="2134218">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134218" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134218/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sensor-Small-but-mighty"><a href="#Sensor-Small-but-mighty" class="headerlink" title="Sensor: Small but mighty"></a><strong>Sensor: Small but mighty</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black boasts a 1&#x2F;2.3-inch 12-megapixel sensor that is built for action. The new and improved image processor now has the ability to stabilize footage through electronic image stabilization technology called HyperSmooth. This feature works by tracking unwanted motion in your videos and algorithmically correcting shake. It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><p> We took the GoPro out and recorded some handheld video as we walked around, which would normally have some shake to it. The footage from the HERO7 Black was smooth and it did not contain any camera shake, almost as if we’d been using a gimbal.</p><p> It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><h2 id="Lens-Great-for-video"><a href="#Lens-Great-for-video" class="headerlink" title="Lens: Great for video"></a><strong>Lens: Great for video</strong></h2><p> The fixed lens on the GoPro HERO7 Black shoots wide or in SuperView mode, the latter of which is an extra-wide field of view and can sometimes give a kind of distorted fisheye effect to your footage. This distortion can be frustrating, but there are ways to work around it during editing, including using video editing software to correct. And when shooting at a lower resolution, the camera can shoot with a linear field of view which reduces the distortion of the lens. The SuperView is not available when shooting in a 4:3 aspect ratio.</p><h2 id="Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates"><a href="#Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates"></a><strong>Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quality of the GoPro HERO7 Black is gorgeous. Content creators and travel vloggers will absolutely appreciate this camera’s recording capabilities.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black, the 4K video looked its best when recording in bright lighting conditions. In lower light, the quality began to degrade and grain started to form in the shadow areas of the scene.</p><p> New to the GoPro HERO7 is the ability to create a TimeWarp video. This feature allows the user to create super smooth time-lapse videos with HyperSmooth technology, so the camera doesn’t have to be stationary. This opens up the ability to be more creative when making time lapse videos.</p><p> The ability to capture 1080p video at 240fps is also a game-changer. The slow-motion feature of this camera is stunning, producing beautiful smooth footage, especially when used in bright lighting conditions. If you’re an athlete looking to record and analyze footage of yourself, the HERO7 Black gives you a great way to slow down footage and study movement.</p><p> The GoPro HERO7 also has a live stream feature. Using the GoPro app, you can set up a live video feed by connecting to your Facebook, YouTube, and various other social media networks. Once connected to the desired account, you will be able to go live within minutes.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938136">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938136">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938136%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938136/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about"><a href="#Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about" class="headerlink" title="Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about"></a><strong>Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about</strong></h2><p> The photo quality on the GoPro HERO7 Black is average, though it does have the ability to create HDR (High Dynamic Range) images.</p><p> Due to the lens distortion, the images that this camera produces have a specific look that you may either love or hate. It also has a fixed lens that does not zoom, so that limits its functionality compared to typical point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> But generally speaking, the GoPro HERO7 Black is not a camera known for its stunning photographs—it is known for its stunning video capabilities. It’s not for someone that wants to use it specifically for still photographs.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch"></a><strong>Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black’s microphones are sensitive and record ambient noise easily. The microphones are located on the body of the camera and any slight touch becomes audible in your video. When taking some handheld footage, we accidentally covered up the microphones with our fingers, which caused the audio to sound muffled in our video.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera.</p><p> The internal microphones are useful if the sound is not a priority in your videos, but if great audio is a necessity, it is best to invest in an external microphone. You can connect one to the HERO7 Black through the USB connection, which opens up possibilities for external microphones, lapel mics, and digital audio recorders to enhance sound recording capabilities.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera. Pairing the 4K resolution with great audio quality, this camera becomes a powerful tool in the hands of the right content creator.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1630055">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-1630055">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcaperobbin.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1630055%2F18460'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1630055/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing"><a href="#Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing</strong></h2><p> Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze with the GoPro HERO7 Black.

For those who are considering the GoPro as a vlogging camera, the PowerShot is another great option. It records video at 1080p rather than 4K, but it has a larger 20.3-megapixel sensor and a 180-degree articulating LCD touchscreen display that’s perfect for self-recording.</p><p> The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II utilizes an advanced DIGIC 7 Image Processor, which creates better photographs than the GoPro HERO7 Black. This image processor also provides better video stabilization and autofocusing for video, though it’s admittedly not as advanced as the GoPro’s HyperSmooth feature.</p><p> Comparing this to the GoPro HERO7 Black, the Canon is much more user-friendly. It’s a better fit for those that want a versatile camera that they can grab and use easily, without having to maneuver through menus on a tiny screen.</p><p><strong><em>Canon PowerShot SX740 HS:</em></strong> Retailing for $400, the Canon PowerShot SX740 HS is right on par price-wise with the GoPro HERO7 Black. The PowerShot is also capable of recording 4K video, but it lacks the frame rates that the GoPro HERO7 Black is capable of. It’s also capable of capturing photos without distortion, which makes it a more versatile camera.</p><p> The PowerShot SX740 HS is geared toward someone that wants a little bit of everything. It can shoot 4K and take photographs, but it doesn’t quite live up to the excellent video quality of the GoPro. The PowerShot is also a more user-friendly device that is suited for people familiar with standard point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> The camera also has a 180-degree adjustable LCD screen, which makes it an even more powerful tool for vloggers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-sx740-hs-review-4705542" >Canon PowerShot SX740 HS Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A rugged and compact action camera with fantastic video stabilization.</strong></p><p> Between the amazing video quality and the enhanced HyperSmooth electronic image stabilization, the GoPro HERO7 Black is perfect for adventurers who want to record or even live-stream their most rugged expeditions. It produces beautiful videos with enhanced color and sharpness and is small enough to wear or mount somewhere without it getting in the way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none;

On top of this, OLED frames are thinner and lighter than their LED predecessors. It’s a powerful combination that makes for a startlingly realistic picture alongside an expanded range of placement options. In the case of the LG C9, it’s a design that’s as smart as it is sleek thanks to the inclusion of Google Assistant and Alexa.</p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED 65-inch C9 (OLED65C9PUA).</p><p> The LG C9 itself is comprised of a pane of glass that covers the OLED panel. This pane stretches across the front of the TV, leaving a remarkable 0.3 inches between the end of the OLED panel and the metal edge. When it is mounted on a wall, the C9 looks fantastic thanks to this slim, bezel-less design, and while it boasts an impressive 65-inch screen, at no point does this top-of-the-line model exceed a width of 1.8 inches.</p><p> For customers with multiple external devices, such as Blu-ray players or gaming consoles, ports are located along the TV’s left-hand side and directly on its backside. These connection options include 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.1 ports, 3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one cable&#x2F;antenna input, one LAN port, and audio connections. The HDMI 2.1 ports are especially important since consoles began emerging in 2020 that rely on HDMI 2.1 such as the Playstation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mxKfDJGuIKYcsSIQoKfzwDbYYmg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_02-3da87ff8439343f691cf02e9234d1f04.jpg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand"><a href="#Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand"></a><strong>Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand</strong></h2><p> Due to its large size and fragile nature, consider where the LG C9 will be most secure before moving ahead with setup. It shouldn’t be placed anywhere where there’s a risk it could be knocked down or climbed on, for instance, so choose a location safely tucked away from pets and children.</p><p> Setup options include securing the TV to the wall or using the provided stand as a table mount. Be careful, however, as the slim frame means that it needs to be handled with care regardless of where it’s placed, otherwise the TV is at risk of bending which could damage the OLED panel. You’ll want to make sure you’ve got an extra pair of hands for any lifting or adjusting in order to ensure its safety.</p><p> The LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended.</p><p> We found the mounting setup process to be straightforward for an afternoon DIY project. When choosing a wall mount, be sure to consider your individual needs as not all mounts are compatible with all building materials. If you have a plaster or masonry, for instance, you’re going to need stronger hardware than a typical mount has to offer. If you have drywall then the majority of TV mounts will be compatible with your home.</p><p> The other important factor when selecting a mount is the weight and screen size the mount is capable of holding. In this case, these measurements are 65 inches and 56 pounds. After this, considerations are based on preferences rather than hardware limitations. Do you want your mount to be fixed or flexible? Would you prefer installing the TV at eye level or would you like it to rest higher? Will you be placing it in a corner or on a flat wall? These are important questions to ask because they influence the kind of mount you’ll bring home. When in doubt, most manufacturers include a compatibility check for the TV’s make and model on their website. If you’re not comfortable measuring, leveling, and drilling into studs, it’s well worth the peace of mind to hire a handyman once you’ve made your selection.</p><p> Once the TV has been installed, LG’s WebOS guides the first-time setup process by prompting inputs for settings ranging from time zone and language up to and including any necessary user agreements. The LG C9 will complete a scan in order to identify the devices and then you’re free to customize the TV’s settings by pressing the gear button on the LG Magic Remote. The first setting we changed was the Auto Power Saving (APS) picture mode, which reduces power use by dimming the brightness of the TV. The other important setting to disable is TruMotion, which smooths motion in TV shows and movies by altering the frame rate of the programming. If your LG’s picture looks a bit too much like a soap opera, chances are you need to disable this setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134247/18498" target="_top" id="2134247">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134247" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134247/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Stunning-picture"><a href="#Image-Quality-Stunning-picture" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Stunning picture"></a><strong>Image Quality: Stunning picture</strong></h2><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off. Even from wide viewing angles, the 4K picture maintains its excellence, with limited washing out and color loss.</p><p> John Wick’s dynamic action scenes and stunning backdrops shine through in gorgeous, gritty detail in_Parabellum_ ; magical realism pops off the screen in Elton John’s biopic_Rocketman_ ; and the intricate wonders of the natural world appear in extraordinarily sharp detail in_Planet Earth II_ .</p><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off.</p><p> These pictures are further enhanced with LG’s α9 Gen 2 intelligent processor, new to 2019’s model. It excels at drawing out detail and correcting quality discrepancies within the picture, such as banding which creates textures and strips in areas of the screen that would otherwise be smooth. This is particularly important given the large screen size and high resolution. While it’s not as bright as an LED TV since it lacks backlighting, it doesn’t need it as the TV already possesses excellent color, a change here would risk washing out the inky blacks on the screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2114264/17093" target="_top" id="2114264">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2114264" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2114264/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-expected"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-expected" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than expected"></a><strong>Audio: Better than expected</strong></h2><p> While OLED TVs aren’t generally known for their great sound quality, the LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended. Audio in TV or movies is generally good, but it struggles to regulate loud and soft noises in a scene. Streaming Lizzo’s_Cuz I Love You_ on Spotify produces a surprising depth of sound, but it’s simply not comparable to a more robust system that a soundbar or home theater system would provide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SZUaFESJi6OZubIeLdK1e9L9FEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_04-c559e4cc6de64f0c8baf4470f883dd9e-4844a7694fb74eb2904f1128ba93f760.jpeg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115911/19272" target="_top" id="2115911">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115911" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115911/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Smooth and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Smooth and easy to use</strong></h2><p> As with earlier models, the LG WebOS powers the C9. It’s a user-friendly interface that makes navigating the TV incredibly smooth, enabling you to switch between apps and features built into the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease. Meanwhile, the LG Magic Remote can function as a traditional remote control, as a mouse would for a computer screen, or issue voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa, making navigating the menus second nature. While most major streaming services are already included (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, to name a few) it’s also possible to download additional apps through the LG store. The drawback to the store, however, is that the apps are somewhat limited in availability.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon’s Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things. These controls extend into your home as well, enabling you to make use of any basic home control features already in place like updating the temperature on your Nest Smart Thermostat. You simply choose which assistant you want at a given time by pressing either the Amazon button on the Magic Remote to toggle Alexa or the microphone button to toggle Google Assistant.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with Google Assistant as well as Amazon’s Alexa.

The LG C9 is a premium 4K TV that sits at the top of this curve, offering integrated smart technologies and excellent picture with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. As such, it comes at a premium price of $2,500 (Amazon) that exceeds the cost of many competitor models, but with so many additional features it’s worth the high price—even if it’s difficult to swallow.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R"><a href="#LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R" class="headerlink" title="LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R"></a><strong>LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R</strong></h2><p> It’s easy to see why the LG C9 is such an attractive model. Between its many bells and whistles, it offers superior quality at a premium price. For users looking for a more down-to-earth price point, QLED TV models offer great picture quality at a lower cost and are a major competitor for OLED models.</p><p> The Samsung 65-Inch Class Q60R (QN65Q60RAFXZA) is a QLED TV that relies on edge lighting behind its screen to transmit light. This light shines through quantum dots within the LED panel which then transmit color through to the screen and create a picture. This differs from the LG C9 model which toggles pixels on and off individually to create inkier blacks and better contrast. While this isn’t a deal breaker for the Q60R, it does mean that the LG C9 panel will have a little more punch since it’s better equipped to balance bright whites with darker blacks.</p><p> If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> The Q60R also uses Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby integration feels somewhat clunky. It’s not uncommon to repeat instructions when Bixby has difficulty understanding basic instructions. The other caveat to be aware of is that the picture does wash out slightly and lose color when looked at from wide viewing angles. If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> Unlike OLED models, QLED models aren’t prone to burn-in. This is a condition where discoloration occurs over a portion of the screen. This happens when OLED TVs are left on the same channel for extensive periods of time. The Q60R also doubles as an excellent gaming TV or monitor thanks to its variable refresh rates and low input lag which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate to that of the source. While the C9 also has a variable refresh rate and a low input lag, its variable refresh rate is only compatible with the Xbox One for now since nothing else uses HDMI 2.1 yet. Generally retailing for around $1,000, the Q60R is less than half the cost of the LG C9, making it a better choice for those concerned about price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-q60r-series-qled-4k-tv-review-4782061" >Samsung Q60R Series QLED 4K TV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An excellent TV you shouldn’t hesitate to buy if you value ease of use and superb image quality.</strong></p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED C9. That said, these improvements aren’t significant leaps, mainly coming from processor improvements and the addition of HDMI 2.1 ports. If you’re simply looking for the best TV from last year and price isn’t a consideration, look no further. On the other hand, there are other great 65-inch 4K TV models that may not have all the extra features the C9 does, but do have comparable quality without breaking the bank.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  OLED C9 65” 4K Smart TV</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>Price  $3,499.00</li><li>Weight  74.7 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  57.1 x 33.9 x 9.9 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>TV Weight without Stand  55.6 pounds</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>AI Assistant  Google Assistant and Alexa built in</li><li>Network &amp; Internet Functionality  Internet video playback, WEB browsing</li><li>Connectivity Options  Bluetooth, LAN, Wi-Fi</li><li>Bluetooth Version  Bluetooth 5.0</li><li>Platform  LG ThinQ AI, webOS</li><li>Resolution  3840 x 2160</li><li>Screen Size  65 inches</li><li>Type  OLED</li><li>Refresh Rate  120 Hz</li><li>Display Format  4k UHD (2160p)</li><li>HDR Technology  4K Cinema HDR, Dolby Vision, HDR 10, Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG)</li><li>Ports  4 HDMI 2.1 Ports, 3 USB Ports</li><li>Audio  Dolby Atmos 2.2 Channel 40 Watts</li><li>Additional Audio Features  Bluetooth audio streaming, Intelligent Voice Recognition, LG Sound Sync</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-solve-youtube-app-crashing-on-nokia-105-classic-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Solutions to Solve YouTube App Crashing on Nokia 105 Classic | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/a-working-guide-for-pachirisu-pokemon-go-map-on-samsung-galaxy-a34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Samsung Galaxy A34 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/apple-mac-mini-with-m1-chip-2020-a-revolutionary-leap-beyond-the-rival-computers/"><u>Apple Mac Mini with M1 Chip (2020): A Revolutionary Leap Beyond the Rival Computers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/evaluating-the-strengths-and-features-of-beatits-powerful-bt-d11-unit/"><u>Evaluating the Strengths and Features of Beatit's Powerful BT-D11 Unit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/hyperx-cloud-alpha-microphone-problems-heres-how-to-fix-them/"><u>HyperX Cloud Alpha Microphone Problems?

Its 256GB storage space is impressive, and its read and write (data transfer) speeds reach 420Mbps and 380Mbps, respectively.</p><p> To put these speeds in perspective, imagine you had 2GB of data. At these speeds, it can transfer the files to a computer in about 40 seconds and transfer them back in about 42 seconds.</p><p> For comparison, our budget recommendation (read speed of 100Mbps and write speeds of up to 30–35Mbps) would take about two minutes and 40 seconds to transfer the files to a computer and nearly nine minutes to transfer them back.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-read-and-write-speeds-2640236" >An Explanation of Read and Write Speeds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In addition to its generous storage space and speed, we thoroughly enjoyed its weighty and sturdy feel. Holding it in hand feels just right, with an even weight distribution throughout. An included keychain hole also helps you attach it to whatever you need (hello, backpack pocket liner!).</p><p> While the SanDisk Extreme PRO is a fantastic device, it’s important to note a few design quirks. The retractable plug is convenient feature, but it can sometimes feel stuck and isn’t as smooth as we’d like.</p><p> However, a simple adjustment in how you push the plug can quickly resolve this. Push your thumb against the retractable plug’s side rather than in the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VzaKxOdaMFqGHZPPFjBAiNP-s3Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_SanDisk256GBExtremePROUSB3.2SolidStateFlashDrive-3517c6beda944a6eb980e748d694c880.jpg"                      alt="SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Solid State Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> This minor inconvenience is unlikely to be a major issue unless you use it constantly.</p><p> Another feature we appreciate about the Extreme PRO is the included RescuePRO Deluxe data recovery suite, which makes it very easy to recover accidentally deleted files. Separately, SanDisk SecureAccess software keeps your information secure using 128-bit encryption.</p><p> Overall, we see the SanDisk Extreme PRO as a true jack of all trades, even compared to other higher-end options on the market.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong>  The SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO has received glowing reviews, with Wirecutter recommending it in its USB flash drive guide.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong>  Most buyers have nothing but good things to say about the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO on Amazon. As of now, it has generated more than 4,400 ratings, with an average of 4.7 stars.</p><h2 id="Also-Great"><a href="#Also-Great" class="headerlink" title="Also Great"></a>Also Great</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX" >Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth 1TB USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5O9M2DYXMkvqQNuAQPz7t89shUM=/fit-in/1500x579/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Corsair-Flash-Survivor-Stealth-1TB-6f7c1dd8417447ca852c5fbfb2d65b95.jpg" >Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth 1TB USB flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX" >$131 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/data-storage/cmfss3b-1tb/flash-survivor-stealth-1tb-usb-3-0-flash-drive-cmfss3b-1tb" >View on Corsair.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Military-grade aluminum housing</li><li>200-meter waterproof rating</li><li>Monstrous storage capacity (1TB)</li><li>Great for high-quality audio formats like WAV or FLAC</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Quite large (8 inches long)</li><li>Not the most intuitive keychain loop</li></ul><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth earns our second pick thanks to its adventurous spirit, waterproof rating, and rugged military-style aluminum casing.

To put that into perspective, it equates to a whopping 209,000 5MB files, enough for a music library that even the most famous international DJ would need, so you’re well covered. Other storage options (128GB and 256GB) exist as well.</p><p> When it comes to usability, this Flash Survivor Stealth USB simply rocks. Hold it and enjoy a sturdy aluminum construction with center ridges for a comfortable grip.</p><p> It’s also waterproof up to 200 meters, though we were in no hurry to submerge it with valuable data inside and find out if it was true.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982462">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982462.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982462">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982462.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982462%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982462/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We also appreciate how the Flash Survivor Stealth USB opens. Grab the keychain loop, unscrew it counterclockwise, and pull it out, revealing the slimmer casing underneath and the USB port. To put it back, pop it in and rotate the end clockwise until it becomes tight (like a bottle cap).</p><p> If there’s one thing we’d improve about the design, it’s the keychain loop. Its integration into the design means the hole is relatively small and difficult to spot. It may also make it hard to clip onto larger key rings. However, keychain loops aren’t crucial for USB flash drives, so we’ll pardon Corsair for this minor usability issue.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth has seen stellar ratings on sites like TweakTown.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> If you look at the Amazon reviews, most Corsair users are pretty ecstatic. Its average 4.5-star rating covers everything from the unit’s durability to its 1TB storage capacity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xOv4XG2m0FAXv2xnn1MqZOuo9o8=/fit-in/1500x1368/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kingston-DataTraveler70-be3585b8673644689895fb96814e0e4c.jpg" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 USB-C flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >$20 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid storage capacity (256GB)</li><li>Moderate reading and writing speeds</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Plastic end caps can be tricky to remove with moist hands</li><li>Good, but not excellent, build quality</li><li>Not as many Amazon ratings as our other recs</li></ul><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is a budget performer, boasting an impressive 256GB storage capacity (great for the price!) and decent, though not exceptional, build quality.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is one of our favorite budget USB drive options. It’s straightforward with few frills, allowing you to easily store your favorite playlist. It boasts a modest read speed of up to 100Mbps and writes speeds of up to 30–35 Mbps.</p><p> A transfer rate of up to 100Mbps means that a large 1GB file can be transferred in less than 10 seconds straight from your Kingston to your device. It performs pretty well with no lag time in opening files, unlike other comparably priced options we’ve tested that missed the mark.</p><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is pretty basic in terms of design. Shaped like a traditional pen drive, it features a plastic end cap and a slight concave ridge for a sturdy grip. Be sure to have dry hands when pulling off the end cap, as it can get stuck.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We recommend this USB flash drive for anyone seeking a quick and affordable solution.

Each excels in different areas.</p><p> To earn passing marks, all of our reviewed USB flash drives must shine in all of the following areas:</p><ul><li>Storage capacity</li><li>Read and write speeds</li><li>Build quality and cost</li></ul><p> Naturally, storage capacity is a matter of preference. An international music DJ may require one terabyte, while a hobbyist may be satisfied with 250GB.</p><p> We also prioritized the highest read and write speeds for our top two picks. Read speed refers to how fast the USB drive can retrieve data from a device (phone, laptop, etc.), whereas write speed refers to how quickly data can be stored.</p><p> If you rarely transfer large files, try to aim for at least 50Mbps read speeds and 20Mbps write speeds. For more regular, large file transfers, we recommend no less than 100Mbps read speeds and 50Mbps write speeds.</p><p> Don’t skimp on build quality either, with a preference toward rugged constructions like the military-grade aluminum Corsair that can withstand plenty of punishment in your bag or purse.</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> When you’re searching for the best overall USB flash drive, it all boils down to individual preferences.</p><p> How many files are you looking to save? For example, if you only have a modest photo library (say, 20,000 5MB photos), then a 100GB USB drive will suffice. Anything more than that, and 256GB or even 1TB options could be your best bet.</p><p> If you only care about fast transfers, try to get the fastest read and write speeds available. Aim for anything over 100 Mbps for read speed and above 30Mbps for writing speed. Remember, writing speed will almost always be slower than reading speed.</p><p> Read our <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-size-usb-flash-drive-do-i-need-2640421" >USB Drive buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><h3 id="Brands-We-Consider"><a href="#Brands-We-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Brands We Consider"></a>Brands We Consider</h3><ul><li>Aneew</li><li>Corsair</li><li>Kingston</li><li>SanDisk</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-flash-drives-for-music-2438381" >The Best USB Flash Drives to Store Music in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Should you buy an external hard drive or a USB flash drive?<br> Consider an external hard drive if you’re looking for a large amount of storage, faster transfer speeds, and don’t mind a large form factor and higher cost. A USB flash drive is the way to go for smaller amounts of data in the most portable size available (and even greater plug-and-play convenience).</li><li>Are USB flash drives good for backing up data long term?<br> Flash drives are some of the less reliable storage mediums and are designed (and best used) as temporary envelopes for data transfer. Traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are the best solution for long-term backup, providing the most data stability and capacity for the price. Or, for a faster solution at a higher price tag, consider a solid disk drive (SSD).</li><li>What’s the difference between USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB-C flash drives?<br> The USB standard a flash drive is built around will determine its potential performance, including the maximum transfer rate. For instance, the transfer ceiling for USB 3.0 is theoretically ten times higher than 2.0. Letters following a USB designation (like USB-A, USB-B, or USB-C) indicate the physical type of connection; USB-A is the familiar rectangle most associated with the standard, while USB-C is a reversible flat oval.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-skype-calls-on-pc-and-mac-free-vs-paid-recording-tips/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mastering Skype Calls on PC & Mac Free vs Paid Recording Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-your-essential-list-of-free-high-quality-online-meeting-software/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Your Essential List of Free, High-Quality Online Meeting Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-apple-homepod-mini-evaluation-exploring-music-playback-intelligent-assistant-and-extra-functions/"><u>Comprehensive Apple HomePod Mini Evaluation: Exploring Music Playback, Intelligent Assistant, and Extra Functions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/recording-your-viewed-youtube-content-violate-laws-for-2024/"><u>Does Recording Your Viewed YouTube Content Violate Laws for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/foremost-usb-flash-drive-recommendations-for-optimal-performance/"><u>Foremost USB Flash Drive Recommendations for Optimal Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-prevent-your-youtube-music-from-freezing-while-video-stops-playing-chrome-and-firefox/"><u>How to Prevent Your YouTube Music From Freezing, While Video Stops Playing (Chrome & Firefox)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-activate-and-use-life360-ghost-mode-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Activate and Use Life360 Ghost Mode On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-gps-on-nokia-g310-for-mobile-legends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Fake GPS On Nokia G310 For Mobile Legends? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/instagram-spotlight-tactics-a-3-step-guide/"><u>Instagram Spotlight Tactics A 3-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/leading-voice-transcription-tools-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Leading Voice Transcription Tools : A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/next-level-innovation-in-a-slim-profile-a-comprehensive-look-at-macbook-pro-m1-2020/"><u>Next-Level Innovation in a Slim Profile: A Comprehensive Look at MacBook Pro M1 (2020)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-s-hottest-adobe-premiere-title-templates-free-download/"><u>Updated S Hottest Adobe Premiere Title Templates - Free Download</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/why-does-my-lava-blaze-2-5g-keep-turning-off-by-itself-6-fixes-are-here-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Why Does My Lava Blaze 2 5G Keep Turning Off By Itself? 6 Fixes Are Here | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
