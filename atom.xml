The Anker PowerDrive 2 is one of the most popular chargers on the market, and it didn’t disappoint during our testing. In addition to its durable plastic construction, it includes a 3-foot micro<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-micro-usb-cables-4178845" >USB cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a dual-port design, and fast recharge rates for your devices thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology.

What’s more, it can do that without<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/problem-with-overheating-laptops-2377646" >overheating <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938721/19272" target="_top" id="1938721">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938721" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938721/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-All-plastic-but-sturdy-and-subtle"><a href="#Design-All-plastic-but-sturdy-and-subtle" class="headerlink" title="Design: All-plastic, but sturdy and subtle"></a><strong>Design: All-plastic, but sturdy and subtle</strong></h2><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 might not be the sharpest or most cutting-edge looking in-car USB charger, but what it lacks in visual pizazz, it more than makes up for in sturdiness.</p><p> A lot of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-usb-port-not-charging-phone-4102780" >in-car USB chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are susceptible to slowly fragmenting. If you yank a USB cable out of the charger haphazardly, the charger might come apart (we encountered this with the RAVPower 24W USB charger). Not so with the Anker PowerDrive 2 which survived weeks of rigorous testing and careless USB cable unpluggings. It’s also fairly compact. It’ll protrude a bit from the 12V port, but it’s not very noticeable.</p><p> Don’t let the diminutive blue LED light fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously.</p><p> That said, it’s not the prettiest charger. The black plastic construction is fine to look at and blends in nicely with most car interiors, but the red ring around the face makes it look a bit cheap. So, too, does the “IQ” logo printed between the two USB ports, but these are fairly minor quibbles. The PowerDrive 2 has a small and unobtrusive LED light to help you find the USB ports in the dark. We found it less distracting than other chargers we tested.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices"><a href="#Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices"></a><strong>Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices</strong></h2><p> The best part of the Anker PowerDrive 2 is its charging. It has the ability to charge iPads simultaneously without getting overheated thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Each USB port can output a maximum 5V&#x2F;2.4A, for a total of 24W. That’s in line with other car<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-phone-chargers-4138571" >chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested, but the PowerIQ technology can help identify device and deliver the fastest possible charge. This also gives you some overvoltage protection to make sure something like a smartwatch doesn’t fry when you plug it in.</p><p> This isn’t quite the same as Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 or other fast charge technologies which vary the voltage and amperage on a larger range, but it’ll top up your phone or other devices faster than a regular charger.</p><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</p><p> One thing to note is that the PowerDrive 2 includes a micro USB cable, in case you don’t want to carry your device’s cable everywhere with you. That’s a nice touch we didn’t get with other chargers we tested.</p><h2 id="Price-Middle-of-the-pack"><a href="#Price-Middle-of-the-pack" class="headerlink" title="Price: Middle of the pack"></a><strong>Price: Middle of the pack</strong></h2><p> The list price of $14.99 is positioned in the mid-range of the USB charger market, which ranges from just a few dollars to upwards of $50 for some fancier chargers. However, Anker PowerDrive 2 can be had for a discounted price on some websites. Considering the fact that the Anker PowerDrive 2 includes both the fast-charger and a 3-foot micro USB cable, it is well priced for the marketplace.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><h2 id="Competition-A-handful-of-rivals"><a href="#Competition-A-handful-of-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A handful of rivals"></a><strong>Competition: A handful of rivals</strong></h2><p> The RAVPower 24W charger is one of Anker’s main rivals. It has a metal exterior, a lower price tag, and theoretically identical power output. However, its construction is far less robust. In fact, its metal outside easily separates from the internal components easily making Anker a better pick for longevity.</p><p> The Aukey CC-S1 charger is a much closer competitor. It has the standard dual 2.4A USB ports, is constructed from plastic, and costs a few dollars less. One advantage it has is that unlike the PowerDrive, the CC-S1 sits virtually flush to the 12V socket. But you don’t get LED lights, which might make it a hindrance to find at night.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ravpower-24w-usb-car-charger-review-4686799" >RAVPower 24W USB Car Charger Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</strong></p><p> The price is fair, the charging is fast, and the design is unobtrusive. It’s hard to ask for much more.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  PowerDrive 2 24W Dual USB Car Charger</li><li>Product Brand  Anker</li><li>SKU  848061073508</li><li>Price  $14.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  2.6 x 1.1 x 1.1 in.</li><li>Ports  2</li><li>Warranty  18-month</li><li>Waterproof  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-ideal-platforms-for-procuring-youtube-ringtone-files/"><u>[New] Ideal Platforms for Procuring YouTube Ringtone Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-adding-motion-blur-effect-in-photoshop/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Adding Motion Blur Effect in Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cinematic-continuity-a-kinemaster-led-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Cinematic Continuity A Kinemaster-Led Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-iphones-automatic-replay-feature/"><u>2024 Approved Navigating iPhone's Automatic Replay Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/advanced-animators-toolkit-samples/"><u>Advanced Animator's Toolkit Samples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/aussie-slang-unleashed-mastering-local-expressions/"><u>Aussie Slang Unleashed: Mastering Local Expressions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/best-value-amazon-kindle-201n-an-in-depth-cost-effective-e-reader-guide/"><u>Best Value Amazon Kindle (201N): An In-Depth Cost-Effective E-Reader Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-oneplus-ace-2v-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Unlock a OnePlus Ace 2V Easily?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-moto-g-play-exceptional-long-lasting-battery-life-meets-reliable-functionality/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of Moto G Play - Exceptional Long-Lasting Battery Life Meets Reliable Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/inside-the-hp-omen-obelisk-a-game-changer-in-affordable-powerful-pcs/"><u>Inside the HP Omen Obelisk: A Game Changer in Affordable, Powerful PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/instant-avoidance-guide-for-edgenuity-courses-for-2024/"><u>Instant Avoidance Guide for Edgenuity Courses for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/mobiles-best-explore-8-leading-free-mp3-download-applications-for-2024/"><u>Mobile's Best Explore 8 Leading Free MP3 Download Applications for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/revolutionizing-tablet-tech-how-the-2018-apple-ipad-pro-11-inches-sets-new-standards-in-consumer-electronics/"><u>Revolutionizing Tablet Tech: How the 2018 Apple iPad Pro (11 Inches) Sets New Standards in Consumer Electronics!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/should-you-spend-on-an-apple-tv-now/"><u>Should You Spend on an Apple TV Now?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/sony-cat-s42-tough-phone-assessment-superior-durability-meets-moderate-performance/"><u>Sony CAT S42 Tough Phone Assessment: Superior Durability Meets Moderate Performance</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Shopping for an inexpensive but high-quality 4K TV under $1,000 that won’t take up too much space? The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) ticks all those boxes. Despite its low price, this Roku TV is rich with features that rival more expensive options.</p><p> We tested the TCL 50S425 and were impressed by the ease of setup, picture quality, and user-friendliness of this<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8IJD6mxL-mHDn0MMWWRd5yZERlc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_04-bbd6d026c9ec48df9f12c934b7def674.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward"><a href="#Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lightweight and straightforward"></a><strong>Design: Lightweight and straightforward</strong></h2><p> Smart TVs range in size, typically starting from 32 inches and reaching all the way up to 85 inches and beyond. If you can’t accommodate or don’t want a really large television, the TCL 50-inch Roku TV offers a decent middle ground that will appeal to shoppers who want an apartment or dorm-friendly TV without sacrificing quality.</p><p> In appearance, the TCL 50S425 doesn’t reinvent the wheel. It’s black, rectangular, and slim. It comes with the option of wall-mounting or setting it up on a media console or other surface with the enclosed stand. With the legs attached, the set measures 44 inches wide, 28 inches tall, and 8 inches deep and weighs only 23.6 pounds. While the screen is categorized in the 50-inch class the size of the display is 49.5 inches on a diagonal. This lack of bulky bezels surrounding the screen contributes to the slim profile of this TV.</p><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV.</p><p> The Roku remote complements the streamlined design of the screen. In the style of other Roku remotes, it’s a compact and almost weightless wand-like infrared device with a simple and straightforward layout. We found it easy to hold in one hand and easily access all 20 buttons without having to make any grip adjustments. There are also a handful of shortcut buttons for quick access to Netflix, Hulu, the Roku Channel, and ESPN. As long as you point it directly toward the TV, you shouldn’t have any problems with remote performance, but we did notice an occasional lag here or there when the remote seemed to hang and then perform multiple actions in quick succession.</p><p> There are some unfortunate design quirks. The remote’s directional buttons are quite loud. They don’t require a hard press to activate, but they make an audible clicking sound. This is slightly jarring since the other buttons are nearly silent when pressed. Another drawback is the LED status indicator located in the bottom center of the display. By default this light is always on. You can turn this indicator off, but it will continue to blink and flash during other operations, which we sometimes found distracting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cT13RJhaMjC05v7eMym3vtM8M0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_05-70fc23cf6c2b4a13ac9d46f9372010ef.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151854/7443" target="_top" id="2151854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151854/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Up and running in minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Up and running in minutes</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 50-inch TCL Roku TV is a breeze. We opted to forego mounting the television, but the user manual indicates that this model is compatible with a VESA 200 x 200 wall mount with M6 x 12mm screws.</p><p> As directed, we placed the monitor face down on a plush surface and attached the two stand legs using the four MS x 25mm screws. After situating the television on a shelf, we plugged the unit into a wall outlet using the enclosed AC power cord. Once the TV was plugged in, it powered on immediately and displayed the guided setup process. These steps were very straightforward and included first setting a language preference, a network connection, and activating the device. The other critical step with setup involves either signing up for or logging into an existing Roku account.</p><p> Since we already had a Roku account, all of our previously selected channels and apps downloaded to the TV, which just took a few minutes, and then we were free to begin exploring. The amount of additional setup is pretty minimal. By default, you’ll see an HDR notification when you’re viewing HDR-enabled content, but you can turn this off from the settings panel if you like.</p><p> Additionally, if you plan to use a set-top cable box or antenna, the user manual offers straightforward instructions for doing so. You also have the option of enabling the Smart TV experience when you use antenna TV mode. This setting uses automatic content recognition (ACR) to make viewing recommendations based on what you view through your antenna or connected HDMI devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012415/19272" target="_top" id="2012415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012415/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking</strong></h2><p> One of the biggest draws of a 4K TV is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which offers four times the resolution quality of a standard high definition TV. This pixel resolution is also commonly referred to as Ultra HD (UHD). This Roku TV also comes with HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which is commonly bundled with 4K resolution in the newest smart TVs.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR improves image quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by intensifying the contrast between white and black areas on the screen while achieving a solid balance, so nothing looks too dark or too bright. It also broadens the palette of available colors, especially in combination with Wide Color Gamut (WCG).</p><p> One thing we noticed right out of the gate is how vivid 4K content looks. To test the 4K image quality, we started by exploring the 4K Spotlight content. This section includes links to 4K movies, TV, and videos. We found a couple of nature-themed 4K videos on YouTube and were really impressed with what we saw. A video touring Zion National Park looked almost 3D and we practically felt like we were there. The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> Apart from 4K nature videos, we also browsed 4K movies and TV shows through the Amazon Prime app. We found the same appealing mix of crisp picture quality, vibrant colors, and contrast. Even standard high definition shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, and Prime looked quite good on screen. Though it’s hard to say if there’s a considerable difference, TCL is eager to boast about the power of their 4K Creative Pro upscaling feature which renders regular HD content into 4K-like quality. The bottom line is that HD content looks great across the board, upscaled or not.</p><p> The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> With the handy multi-purpose asterisk button you can alter a number of display settings, and you can access this options menu in the middle of viewing content. Adjusting picture settings doesn’t require exiting an app or pausing whatever you’re watching, which lets you make adjustments and immediately see the result. You can add more vibrancy and contrast to whatever you’re watching, or enable modes like Movie when you’re viewing a film in the evening or with the lights dimmed.</p><p> You can control everything from backlighting to brightness, contrast, and dynamic contrast. This last setting is particularly relevant to HDR content because it helps balance the light and dark settings on your screen so that there’s no excess in either direction. The online user manual does a fine job of explaining some of the advanced picture settings, and even just toggling through the menu on the TV brings up a description of what you’re changing.</p><p> Regular picture mode and the predefined 4K HDR picture settings were on point, which made viewing right out of the box extremely easy and pleasant. We were also pleased by the picture quality from all angles. Getting too close or too far out to the right or left did reveal some shadows and distortion, but only at fairly extreme angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Lv4B9e6LaJSHW7NSl-Braa2vnmc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_03-b8155781e440420aa0c6c2bf19f9fe6a.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding</strong></h2><p> While the TCL Roku TV offers impressive picture quality, the sound is less noteworthy. The two built-in 8-watt speakers offer decent volume levels, but there’s no advanced audio settings menu in this model. You do have control over aspects like sound mode and volume mode. The default sound mode is “normal,” which is appropriate for everyday viewing. But you can also select options for higher treble, more bass, movie, or music mode. As for volume modes, you can either turn on leveling, to balance the contrast between lows and highs in audio, or enable night mode, which sets a threshold for how high the volume can go.</p><p> We did notice some issues with what sounded like crackling and extreme lows and highs in dialog and music, though we were able to smooth these issues out by tweaking a few settings.</p><p> In our testing experience in a small room, the internal speakers were more than adequate without the need for additional speakers. If you do want another layer of dimension to your audio, you might consider opting for the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-speakers-and-home-theater-1846770" >wireless speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> designed specifically for Roku TV sets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oA3AbTZysdVWZbOWuuVGOa56_8c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_02-04183ae8dcd44b778b4da0e7706d5df2.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528700/16446" target="_top" id="1528700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528700/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive and streamlined"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive and streamlined</strong></h2><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV and a big part of the equation is the operating system. The TCL 50S425 operates on Roku OS 9.1, and it’s extremely user-friendly. Updates are automatic so there’s no manual effort required on your part, and the interface is laid out in a clear and uncomplicated manner.</p><p> The Home screen features all of your apps, which you can arrange and delete with the click of the asterisk button. All the other menus are easy to identify as well. There’s a search page, a streaming channels section, and the settings menu. This clean and straightforward layout may not be the most sophisticated, but it’s easy to use and simplicity is the beauty of this system.</p><p> While the remote doesn’t come with a built-in speaker, the free Roku app does offer a voice-assistant feature. It’s best when completing a general search for a show or actor or for launching a particular app. If you have a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa enabled device, this Roku TV will support them, and they offer a generally better experience than using the Roku app voice remote function.</p><h2 id="Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great bargain on a budget"></a><strong>Price: A great bargain on a budget</strong></h2><p> If you don’t want to spend a fortune on a 4K TV, but you want to get as much value as possible, the TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a compelling option. It retails for $350, which situates it in the growing and competitive class of 4K TVs under $500. In the TCL 4-Series alone you have several other models to consider that all share the same specifications except for size. The larger 55-inch TCL Roku TV retails for just $30 more than the 50-inch version and features a larger screen size of 54.6 inches. It may not seem considerable, but if you’re limited with space, the extra width and height (five and two inches, respectively) can actually feel like a pretty massive difference. And if you opt for a smaller display and a lower price tag, the 43-inch TCL Roku TV retails for about $280, but you’re sacrificing 7 inches of display.</p><h2 id="TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition"><a href="#TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition" class="headerlink" title="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"></a><strong>TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</strong></h2><p> The TCL 50-inch Roku TV is not without external competitors either. The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition retails for about $100 more and runs on the Fire OS, which stands toe-to-toe with the Roku platform with access to over 500,000 shows and movies. The Toshiba Fire TV comes with an Alexa-enabled remote, an edge for shoppers who want the ease of a voice assistant built right into the remote. But the Roku TV supports both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as voice control through the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> While the Toshiba TV is in the 55-inch class, the screen size is actually the same as the Roku TV. The former, however is visibly taller, wider, and bulkier. The Toshiba Fire TV does havea slight advantage when it comes to audio quality. The sound can get quite loud and full-bodied, thanks to two 10-watt speakers and DTS Studio Sound&#x2F;DTS TruSurround. On the other hand, the picture quality may not be as impressive as the Roku TV, which really doesn’t require a lot of tweaking to enjoy. And if you’re a fan of the simple Roku interface, you may find the Fire OS dashboard to be a bit cluttered.</p><p> Browse our other recommendations on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >best smart TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and best TVs under $500.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/toshiba-55lf711u20-55-inch-fire-tv-edition-review-4772221" >Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A budget-friendly 4K TV that offers impressive picture and overall value.</strong></p><p> The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a smart 4K TV that possesses many merits: an appealing price point, excellent 4K HDR picture quality, a size profile that won’t overwhelm small rooms or apartments, and an easy-to-use interface that requires little fuss. You may find better 4K picture and audio quality in a higher-end model, but this TV offers a welcome smart TV upgrade at a price that won’t empty your pockets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a

Star Wars: Squadrons grants you the second of these fantasies to a never before seen degree. This long-overdue follow up to the 1993 classic Star Wars: X-Wing aims to offer the same intense dogfighting, but with the advantages of modern tech. I reviewed the PC version.</p><h2 id="Setup-Some-tinkering-required"><a href="#Setup-Some-tinkering-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Some tinkering required"></a><strong>Setup: Some tinkering required</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons has a fairly hefty download before it’s playable, so be sure your hard drive has at least 26.4 GB of storage space. When the game boots up you can alter basic settings to set language, volume, display settings, and everything else needed to optimize your experience. I struggled a bit to get it to play well with my dual-screen setup, but eventually, I was able to get it to a playable state on my ultra-widescreen Samsung CHG90 display. In the end, I found it more comfortable to play on a standard 16:9 aspect ratio monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1xt9t7ffMjuv6ggtXGJER_irSnk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-2-fcfb7e9a60e74ce9b42cecff0e2061ed.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps"><a href="#Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps" class="headerlink" title="Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps"></a><strong>Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps</strong></h2><p> The game picks up after the destruction of Alderaan in A New Hope. You get to play both sides of the conflict in alternating story missions as both an Imperial pilot and a Rebel pilot. Both characters are customizable with a range of preset options. I always appreciate it when a game gives me the option to create my own character.</p><p> The range of presets is fairly limited, but welcome nonetheless. As is traditional for me, I chose to rename the protagonists after characters from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. The Rebel hero became Lu-Tze, with the evil Vorbis on the side of the Empire. I was happy to be able to find a suitably sinister British accent for Vorbis, though hilarious results are possible with mismatched voices and characters. In the end, though, you’ll be spending most of the game from a first-person perspective, with your character only briefly present in cutscenes.</p><p>Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p> Next, you can choose whether you’d like a more guided experience with the standard HUD, or if you’d prefer a more immersive and challenging experience. The game also offers a mode where only your cockpit instruments are displayed. It’s probably a good idea to start off in the standard mode until you get to grips with the controls and gameplay. Lastly, choose your difficulty setting (which will depend on your general experience with flight games), and you’re off to battle.</p><p> Squadrons starts off with an obligatory tutorial mission to teach you how to fly. Though it’s somewhat prolonged, the initial awe of the scenery of an Imperial battlegroup banishes any boredom that you might expect from a tutorial mission. Gliding around Star Destroyers and other classic Star Wars spaceships is quite an experience.</p><p> The story is passable, if not terribly deep or ambitious, and is basically there to connect the battle sequences and give context to the fight. Voice acting varies from mediocre to passable, and there’s clearly some effort put into establishing likeable characters. However, though the character models are good, there’s definitely a bit of the uncanny valley on display here, and it’s particularly noticeable in the first-person conversations where you stare dumbly on as an NPC spouts exposition at you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_MN0adYtaTCJ1Qhmsivk-M-DkXo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-3-31074635684244d48b1d792540a477e2.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> In between story missions you are fixed in place in different rooms, where you click on different characters to talk to them. I found these sequences to be very linear and I found that they tended to drag on. I’d certainly have preferred to be able to walk around rather than teleport between locations on the ship. This is probably due to this game being intended to be played in VR where the fixed positioning makes more sense due to the limitations of VR, but the game would’ve been well served by separate control schemes. This is a minor gripe; if desired you can just skip through these sequences pretty quickly.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep"><a href="#Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep"></a><strong>Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep</strong></h2><p> The real meat of the game is in battle, and it’s an incredibly intense and immersive experience. Whatever system or control method you’re utilizing, there are a lot of different inputs and functions to learn. This would be daunting to newcomers, but the campaign does a great job of gradually introducing new controls and mechanics at a pace that makes them easy to pick up.</p><p> One of the most complex aspects of the game is team and system management, which involves making quick decisions about the layout of your ship and the behaviour of your allies. The basic power systems are easy to master, and simple “attack this” and “defend that” commands aren’t hard to learn, but there are more complicated systems as well that add a level of depth to the game for dedicated players.</p><p> Both the empire and rebels have a range of four classes of ships to choose from - a jack-of-all-trades fighter, a slow bomber with a fearsome arsenal of weapons, a fast and agile interceptor, and a support class ship. I really appreciated that the game doesn’t just make these reskinned mechanically identical clones for each faction. Instead, each side has its unique quirks that affect gameplay, and somehow the designers were still able to balance the game so that neither team feels outgunned by the other.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive. There is some of the traditional looping around in circles, but between the obstacles placed about the map, the different capabilities of the various ships, and the interaction between you and your teammates, this happens only occasionally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/COT6eEVvzd6QqCbhmtbP4a_C--Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-6-9d086810906a486b9266ec247e2ab966-3636fb8670644ae98afd0bc57b59df8d.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037351/7443" target="_top" id="2037351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037351/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The one thing that pulled me out of the game at times was the somewhat wonky ship physics, which make sense from the pilot’s seat, but look a bit weird to see from other ships. You can stop quickly and turn on a dime, which benefits gameplay on a technical level, but is a bit jarring and unrealistic to witness.</p><p> One important aspect of gameplay is how Squadrons balances the fragility of its fighters with creating a fun experience. It does this using shields and repair kits that vary from ship to ship and which can be customized. It walks the fine line between allowing you to mow down enemy fighters without wailing away at them for ages, while also preventing you from feeling like you’re piloting a glass canon.</p><p> There’s also ship customization, which allows you to alter various aspects of your aircraft such as armament, hull, and engines to enhance various attributes, though this usually comes at a cost to other capabilities. For example, you can trade speed for extra agility and vice versa. It requires a deep understanding of the ship you’re customizing so you’ll probably want to wait to touch this till you’ve had plenty of practice in battle. There are also cosmetic customizations, such as paint jobs and ornaments. Both gameplay and cosmetic customizations are purchased with separate types of in-game currency.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous. Ships are lovingly rendered and great detail was paid to getting the lighting, environments, and effects just right. The cockpits of the different ships you pilot are fully realized and mesmerizing in their realism. It’s easy to get sucked into ogling a grand alien vista or just reveling in the experience of being in the cockpit of an honest to goodness X-Wing. Explosions, lasers, enemy ships tearing apart in fiery gouts of flame, and the realistic damage to your own ship, provoke many tense situations that hit home and are bound to get your heart racing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a-_aXPmbq5vlMG21Sutf0cIe4BI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-7-dc3679df974e4da793c52f2fb2831eac.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The game is less attractive in VR, with muddier textures and blurrier skybox, but the trade-off for added immersion is well worth the sacrifice. Actually moving your head to scan around the glass cockpit for enemy fighters and capital ships (or your own wingmates) and then diving in to engage is some of the most fun you can have in VR.</p><h2 id="Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars"><a href="#Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Authentic Star Wars"></a><strong>Audio: Authentic Star Wars</strong></h2><p> With the vast majority of video games, your experience is almost as dependent on what you hear as what you see. In this regard, Squadrons is a masterpiece. This game perfectly replicates the epic feel of classic Star Wars space combat from the laser fire, to the roar of your engines, to the exhilarating whoosh of grazing an asteroid. There’s also the unforgettable John Williams soundtrack, which is fully present here and is just as vital to the experience of the game as it is to the films.</p><h2 id="Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs"><a href="#Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs"></a><strong>Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs</strong></h2><p> I was able to get consistently high frame rates during gameplay with my custom gaming PC running 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X processor, and an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU. However, I experienced some odd stuttering in the hanger between missions, which seemed more of a graphical bug than an issue with the power of my PC. I also played Squadrons on a laptop with a less powerful processor, 16GB of RAM, and a Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q. The game performed well and provided a smooth gameplay experience at maximum graphical settings.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975816/19272" target="_top" id="1975816">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975816" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975816/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs"><a href="#Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs" class="headerlink" title="Controls: Wide support for different inputs"></a><strong>Controls: Wide support for different inputs</strong></h2><p> Squadrons offers customizable support for a wide range of different control schemes, from gamepads to HOTAS flight sticks to mouse and keyboard. I had to fiddle with a few settings to get my stick and thrust control up and running, but when I did, it added an extra layer of immersion to the experience. However, mouse and keyboard is clearly the optimal and intended control method for Squadrons.</p><h2 id="Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights"><a href="#Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights"></a><strong>Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights</strong></h2><p> Squadrons features a basic but robust multiplayer mode, the bread and butter of which are team-based dogfights. These are exciting and challenging matches that truly test your skill at the game, and thanks to a decent selection of varied maps it really doesn’t get old.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oKG6kRHcFEOz3O6bwL5_SyeUiEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-4-78947bfe57874d45ae8f401482c3ddf6-379a507c078e44d6898e28d20f53aac9.jpeg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The other mode features massive large scale multi-stage fleet battles, which require careful team coordination to advance across the battlefield and destroy the enemies’ flagship. It’s a good idea to save this for after you’ve played through most of the campaign, learned the controls, and have tried your hand at a few multiplayer dogfights.</p><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a><strong>Price: Good value</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of just $40 Star Wars: Squadrons is a surprisingly reasonably priced game that bucks the trend of modern AAA games uniformly releasing for $60 regardless of what content they are able to offer. It’s not the longest game, and there is a limit to end-game multiplayer content, so $40 is pretty much the exact right price for Squadrons. It’s refreshing to see a distinct lack of any extra monetization in the game, with no annoying microtransactions or loot boxes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144287/7443" target="_top" id="2144287">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144287" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144287/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous"><a href="#Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous"></a><strong>Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a deeper, more daunting, complex space sim, Elite Dangerous is the next step. Squadrons is far more exciting, being laser-focused on intense aerial combat. Elite Dangerous is a more methodical game, with a focus on exploration and trading, though there’s also exciting combat there if you want it.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> An exhilarating space combat experience that is particularly well suited to VR.</p><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is a fine successor to classic space combat games, and is an undeniably exciting and realistic experience. It’s best if played with a VR headset, but is worth your time and money on a traditional screen as well. The memory of my first flight at the helm of a TIE Fighter in this game has stuck with me with surprising clarity in a way that few moments in video games do, and it’s something you really have to experience for yourself to understand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1630055">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-1630055">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcaperobbin.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1630055%2F18460'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1630055/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Star Wars: Squadrons</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Rating  Teen</li><li>Platform  PC, PS4, Xbox One</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-exploring-social-networking-youtube-content-on-fb-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exploring Social Networking YouTube Content on FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-infuse-sound-and-style-into-your-windows-10-photos-app/"><u>[Updated] How to Infuse Sound and Style Into Your Windows 10 Photos App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-strategies-for-writing-persuasive-vlog-show-narratives/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Strategies for Writing Persuasive Vlog Show Narratives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-scaling-up-content-convert-youtube-to-igtv/"><u>[Updated] Scaling Up Content Convert YouTube to IGTV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/concert-safety-in-a-small-package-top-earplug-pick/"><u>Concert Safety in a Small Package: Top Earplug Pick</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/dell-xps-ebt-2-in-1-assessment-where-exceptional-power-and-design-collide/"><u>Dell XPS Ebt 2-in-1 Assessment: Where Exceptional Power and Design Collide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/enhancing-your-playtime-the-razer-portal-wi-fi-routers-triumph-in-our-test-drive/"><u>Enhancing Your Playtime: The Razer Portal Wi-Fi Router's Triumph in Our Test Drive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/exploring-the-features-of-amazfit-bip-is-it-ideal-for-first-time-smartwatch-users/"><u>Exploring the Features of Amazfit Bip - Is It Ideal for First-Time Smartwatch Users?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-iphone-xr-to-other-iphone-11-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-data-from-ios-transfer-data-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer Data From iPhone XR To Other iPhone 11 devices?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Rexing V1 DashCam is a great choice if you’re in the market for a security-style dashboard camera. Its size and shape are more suited to windshield mounting than other models we tested, plus it captures high-definition footage, decent sound, and is an overall reliable device.</p><p> It has all the additional features you’d expect from a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/types-of-dash-cameras-534889" >dashcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , like loop recording and crash detection, and even some unique ones like timelapse recording. If you’re in the market for a dashcam, the Rexing V1 is definitely worth considering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JfL4E5NnuBPl6-93Hv3PI4IJsV0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_05-bcfff5f440b545378c9ee4e6b431ffac.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield"><a href="#Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield" class="headerlink" title="Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield"></a><strong>Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 Dashcam has a more distinctive form factor than other models we reviewed. Unlike many popular dashcam models, the V1 doesn’t resemble a point-and-shoot camera that hangs from your windshield. Rather, it’s angled to fit the curve of the glass. This makes for a more integrated, smooth look.</p><p> And it’s not just looks that make the design appealing. The fact that it’s not a simple square allows easier access to the control panel, improves the viewing angle of the display, and makes navigating the already-simple interface a bit easier.</p><p> There’s only one way to install this camera in your car, and that’s via a mount that sticks to your windshield with an adhesive strip. Fortunately, this works really well and the mount stays in place—throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it. And once the camera was installed on our windshield, it was very easy to slide it on and off the mount.</p><p> Throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it.</p><p> At just 2.7 inches, the display on this dash cam is the smallest among the devices we tested, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. All the icons, menus, and video footage itself are perfectly visible up close. And you probably don’t want to be paying attention to the screen while you’re behind the wheel, anyways—the at-a-glance view of the camera’s status is all you need.</p><p> It also has an internal accelerometer that can detect the impact of an accident, as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the necessary equipment to use the GPS feature—if you want to enable these, you have to buy the<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Rexing-GPS-Logger-V1-V1P/dp/B01AKH377A/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4770571%7Cn9eae1cd5706347139b8b83241f9d42ea10%7C" >Rexing GPS Logger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> separately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ztn3EsFqtKkWImvQhtgcr1vlHwI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_02-9ee3aa46e7394a1ab263a6b12b287314.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it</strong></h2><p> For those concerned about the hassle of installing a dashcam, don’t worry. The user manual for the Rexing V1 was the clearest and most detailed of all the dashcams we tested. The instructions are written in easy-to-understand language, and every button, feature, and tool is explained in detail so there’s no guesswork when you turn the device on.</p><p> Attaching this dash cam to your windshield is easy. Simply pull the plastic off the double-sided adhesive on the mount and stick it where you want it to go. However, you should be very careful when you’re doing this and make absolutely certain that you want it where you put it the first time. After a few seconds of being attached, it’s on there for good, and it takes a decent amount of ingenuity and elbow grease to get it off. Once it’s off, you can’t reapply it.</p><p> One of the things we appreciated about this dash cam is that it includes a 32GB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you won’t have to put out extra cash to get one. However, there is no microSD card adapter, so if you want to review your footage on a computer you’ll have to buy one of those.</p><p> Also included in the box is a special tool that helps you hide the power cable. To prevent the wire from hanging down in front of your windshield, you need to wedge it up under the edge of the roof and through the side panels (the instruction manual shows you the best route to take). It may seem complicated at first, but this whole process only took us about ten minutes to accomplish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/df0_L-UzAk3OryqSCncsjfqi8QM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_03-2273fff3f71944368711b60f5da9687e.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134492/18498" target="_top" id="2134492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134492/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Basic"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Basic" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Basic"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Basic</strong></h2><p> You can set this dash-mounted camera to capture footage in either 720p or 1080p resolution, which is pretty limited. Similar dashcams can capture footage up to 2560 x 1440 resolution, with others going all the way up to 4K. However, if all you’re looking for is a simple security device, 1080p will do just fine.</p><p> When we reviewed the footage captured by the Rexing V1, we found it to be highly detailed and clear when the car was moving along city streets. However, when we hit the freeway, the picture became a little less clear. Signs were hard to read unless you stopped the recording, and small details such as license plates and bumper stickers on other cars couldn’t be made out at all. Nevertheless, the videos yield a good picture of what happens when you drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9_1pHoEq74JWPJ8reothv8PeI8E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_04-c5d42af8ddfa4296a6c6b1e8551edef6.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it"><a href="#Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Set it and forget it"></a><strong>Performance: Set it and forget it</strong></h2><p> During our testing, we took the Rexing V1 on several lengthy drives through the cities and countryside of northern Utah. In the week that we had it, we never had a problem with how it functioned. It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving. This is one of those devices that embodies the “set it and forget it” mentality.</p><p> This dashcam uses loop recording, which means that it is continuously recording while your car is on, but splices it up into manageable bits rather than one long file. Rexing recommends setting this to three minutes, but you have options to set it to five- and ten-minute intervals as well. When your memory card fills up, the device automatically overwrites the oldest files.</p><p> It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving.</p><p> This dashcam is also equipped with an internal accelerometer that gives it the ability to detect a traffic accident. When it senses that an incident has occurred, it automatically locks the video for that time to prevent it from being overwritten. This is a common feature among the dash cams we tested, but it works well and is a great way to protect yourself if you ever need to prove what happened in an accident.</p><p> One feature that is unique to the Rexing V1 is time-lapse recording. It is turned off by default and Rexing recommends you keep it off for your day-to-day driving. But if you’re taking a road trip with scenic routes or want to record a particular journey, this feature is fun to have.</p><p> Like the rest of the dashboard cameras we tested, the Rexing V1 has the ability to record audio, but it does a middling job of it. Voices in the car and sounds coming from the interior speakers were clear enough to understand, but sounds from outside the vehicle were muddy at best.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144297/7443" target="_top" id="2144297">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144297" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144297/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-good-value"><a href="#Price-A-good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A good value"></a><strong>Price: A good value</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 retails for $130, but as of the time of this writing, can typically be purchased for closer to $100. We feel like this is a perfectly appropriate price for this device—it falls right in the middle of the typical dashcam price range, providing better performance than super budget models, but without the high-tech features of the more expensive options out there. In short, it’s a good price for a solid, basic device.</p><h2 id="Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1"><a href="#Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1"></a><strong>Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1</strong></h2><p> If you’re wondering if you want to pay the extra $25 or so for the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam (which retails for $125), the decision will come down to form factor and image quality—everything else is pretty much the same.</p><p> The Z3 Plus is square and hangs from your windshield from a suction cup, so it can stick out like a sore thumb. The V1 doesn’t have that problem since it’s angled to fit your windshield, but the adhesive tape that holds it on is one-time-use only. If you make a mistake when installing it, you may end up wishing for the Z3’s clunky suction cup design.</p><p> If the Rexing V1’s 1080p resolution is good enough for you, there’s no need to put down extra cash for more pixels. The video is definitely high-res enough to use as a security device, and can effectively capture an accident or other incident. But if you want great video footage that you’ll enjoy watching in the future, an extra $25 isn’t too high a price to pay.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It delivers on what it was designed to do, without any extras.</strong></p><p> There isn’t much to complain about with the Rexing V1 DashCam.

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151871/7443" target="_top" id="2151871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135397/19272" target="_top" id="2135397">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135397" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135397/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115932/19272" target="_top" id="2115932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886044/19272" target="_top" id="1886044">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886044" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886044/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C302 Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  TopMate</li><li>MPN  C302</li><li>Price  $30.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2016</li><li>Weight  1.09 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.2 x 10.43 x 1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Ports  USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/eciphering-youtubes-profit-for-a-mil-of-viewers/"><u>[New] Deciphering YouTube’s Profit for A Mil of Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-platform-showdown-podcast-vs-youtube/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Platform Showdown Podcast vs YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-seaside-shots-comparison-gopro-hero5-and-sjcam-sj7/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Seaside Shots Comparison GoPro Hero5 & SJCAM SJ7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-powerhouse-a-closer-look-at-the-hewlett-packards-15-notebook-featuring-amd-cpu/"><u>Budget-Friendly Powerhouse: A Closer Look at the Hewlett-Packard's 15 Notebook Featuring AMD CPU</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-explore-the-world-of-mobile-video-editing-with-snapchat-favorites/"><u>In 2024, Explore the World of Mobile Video Editing with Snapchat Favorites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-motorola-mg7700-dependability-meets-rapid-performance/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Motorola MG7700: Dependability Meets Rapid Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/maxoaks-ultimate-charge-companion-in-depth-review-of-the-185-wh50000-mah-battery-pack/"><u>MaxOak's Ultimate Charge Companion -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game focused on single-player immersion in a fantasy world. It was originally released in 2011 and has most recently been ported over to the Switch. We took a close look at this game on its newest platform, playing it on the go to test the handheld gameplay experience, along with the plot and graphics.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959712/19272" target="_top" id="1959712">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959712" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959712/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-for-all-users"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-for-all-users" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple for all users"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple for all users</strong></h2><p> As with other games on the Nintendo Switch, you’ll need to insert the cartridge into your device. Skyrim does take a while to launch, so be patient as it loads up. There shouldn’t be any special downloads required, like with other games, and as soon as things load you’ll be able to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uXDVHaBrdIlv5tI-qRgiPK0Iig4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW415460721-e6a53664e7eb4e65a75bf5cceb928e28.jpg"                      alt="The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129041/19576" target="_top" id="2129041">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129041" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129041/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Plot-A-huge-world-with-loads-to-explore"><a href="#Plot-A-huge-world-with-loads-to-explore" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A huge world with loads to explore"></a><strong>Plot: A huge world with loads to explore</strong></h2><p> First, let’s just take a moment to mention that this review covers The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim―a game that was originally released in November of 2011 for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. That’s right, the game is now over seven years old. In 2016, Skyrim released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. They even released a VR version of the game last year, shortly after releasing the Switch version.</p><p> To say this game has a history, and a huge fandom, is an understatement. Jokes about Bethesda forever re-releasing Skyrim on new platforms have been circulating through the gaming world for a while now. All of these thoughts were running through our head when we started playing Skyrim for the Switch. Is another version of this game for another platform really necessary? We wanted to stand firm and say no. We wanted to begrudge Bethesda for releasing Skyrim yet again rather than creating something new. There’s just one problem: Skyrim is a good game, and Nintendo’s Switch is an amazing system.</p><p> Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim starts with you on the back of a cart, your hands bound and a few other prisoners with you. You’re being taken to a location where an executioner is going to chop off your head. Of course, if you died, this wouldn’t be much of game, so it doesn’t come as a big surprise when a dragon swoops down from the sky and interrupts things. With your newfound freedom, you’ll venture to a nearby city and give the Jarl there a warning that a dragon is coming. You’ll help kill this dragon, and after, you’ll learn you’re special. You’re Dragonborn.</p><p> There are a variety of stories for you to get involved in, many of which you can solve in whatever manner you please, whether that’s by being diplomatic or murdering everyone you see.</p><p> You can suck up the power of a dragon, which can then be used to in a special form of magic, called a shout. Shouts range from knockout shouts (Fus Ro Dah!), shouts that let you jump, ones that freeze, etc. You’ll spend a good chunk of the game hunting down words of power and learning new shouts, while also killing more dragons, hunting for more treasure, and slaughtering loads of draugr along the way.</p><p> It’s important to remember that Skyrim is an open-world, role-playing game with loads of possibilities. You can choose where you go, and which side missions you want to do. There are a variety of stories for you to get involved in, many of which you can solve in whatever manner you please, whether that’s by being diplomatic or murdering everyone you see. That’s the true beauty of Skyrim―how much control the game gives you over your character. The world building in the game is also beautifully done, with missions that allow you to learn more about the worlds myths, legends, and gods, but also books that help flesh out the lore.</p><p> When it comes to role-playing games, Skyrim balances player control perfectly with world immersion. You can learn everything there is to know about the world of Skyrim if you wish, or you can just run along killing things and doing the main missions. It’s really up to you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1fxH7ty_kqxpugJDk2tIQndKvI0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW41546078-6bdc67e56311473f9c1edeab00d2caa5.jpg"                      alt="The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880944/19272" target="_top" id="1880944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880944/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Not-as-smooth-as-on-other-platforms"><a href="#Gameplay-Not-as-smooth-as-on-other-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Not as smooth as on other platforms"></a><strong>Gameplay: Not as smooth as on other platforms</strong></h2><p> The first real interactive thing you do with the game is to create your character, and true to other Elder Scrolls games, you can change your character’s appearance in the most minute way. Pick your race, gender, hairstyle, eye color, and even tweak the height of your cheekbones and brows if you want. This is the first sign of just how encompassing and involved the role-playing aspects of Skyrim are.</p><p> The action comes in through the fighting―an integral part of the game, as important as the role-playing. You’ll be able to hone your combat abilities, whether with the magic of a mage, the arrows of a ranger, or the sword of a fighter. You’ll be able to choose whether or not you want to be stealthy, sneaking up on foes, or running straight at them, axe swinging.</p><p> We often found ourselves struggling to face an oncoming attacker, or struggling with the motion controls to aim our bow.</p><p> Skyrim does an amazing job of setting up an open-world fighting system that really allows you to control how your character fights and levels. There’s just one issue: the open fighting system is amazing when you’re playing on PC, but on the Switch, it just isn’t as smooth. We often found ourselves struggling to face an oncoming attacker, or struggling with the motion controls to aim our bow. We quickly resorted to axes and swords, swinging wildly at enemies because it just felt easier on the Switch than taking the time to be precise with the bow.</p><p> Overall, that was our biggest complaint about Skyrim for the Switch. On PC, it’s actually pretty amazing just how much control you have, especially with all the mods you can download. But on the Switch, the number of buttons you have are limited, and doing things like sprinting is far more awkward than just pressing shift. Instead, you’ll have to use a combination of both joysticks and one of your left buttons. Your B key opens a menu, which again can be clunky and awkward to flip between the map, which you need often, and your inventory.</p><p> The lock-picking system gives you haptic feedback, and shouts and spells are done with the upper left and right buttons. Overall, the gameplay was designed to function fluidly with a keyboard and a mouse, and when simplified down to two joysticks and a handful of buttons, becomes complicated and far less smooth. After some time we did get better at the controls, but it never felt natural and we often had to adjust our grip to turn before we found the enemy attacking us.</p><p> Check out our article on<a class="link"   href="https://www.liveabout.com/skyrim-hacks-and-cheats-4159422" >Skyrim hacks and cheats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2Fk-UTwglmoCdE7IXrXqlnXs9do=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW415460712-6cec58625d13430db671be3144451cbc.jpg"                      alt="The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Graphics-A-bit-outdated"><a href="#Graphics-A-bit-outdated" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: A bit outdated"></a><strong>Graphics: A bit outdated</strong></h2><p> The graphics in Skyrim aren’t awful, but they haven’t progressed much since 2011. If you’ve played any other version of Skyrim, you can overlook it, simply because you know what you’re getting into. Bethesda attempted to make Skyrim look realistic, likely in their desire to give you a fully immersive experience. But these days, Skyrim’s graphics just aren’t as realistic as what other, more recent games have accomplished. In places, the mountains look blocky and the grass a little patchy. Character’s faces sometimes seem deeply sunken around the eyes, with the skin looking more like leather than flesh. It’s not that the graphics are overly bad, they’re just not as good as what you can get with better hardware on the PC.</p><h2 id="Platform-Take-Skyrim-on-the-go"><a href="#Platform-Take-Skyrim-on-the-go" class="headerlink" title="Platform: Take Skyrim on the go"></a><strong>Platform: Take Skyrim on the go</strong></h2><p> Considering The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is available on so many other devices, it raises the question of whether or not it’s worth getting for the Switch. First, let’s talk about the negatives. We mentioned our issues with the controls earlier. If you’re used to playing the game with a mouse and keyboard, the controls on the Switch just aren’t as easy to use.</p><p> The other advantage to playing on PC is the variety of mods available for download. There are more than you can imagine, with features that range from making the visuals more pleasing, to adding entirely new lands, quests, and characters.</p><p> But there are some advantages to playing on the Switch, the main one being the ability to take the game on the go. The Switch is the first platform that allows you to take Skyrim with you. You can play in the car or on an airplane, which is a feature that‘s hard to beat. Motion controls are also a unique selling point. You can hook up your Switch to a TV or a monitor, and hold the two Joy-Cons freely in each hand. Instead of clicking a button to swing your weapon, you’ll swing your hand. It actually feels pretty instinctual to play like this, adding another fun element to the game.</p><p> Take a peek at our guide to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-main-quest-walkthrough-4108527" >Elder Scrolls V.

You might be able to find it on sale on Amazon for less, but it’s still on the more expensive side like other popular Switch games. This is disappointing since you can find Skyrim on other platforms for a fraction of the cost, even snatching it up for sale on Steam for $25 or less on PC. Considering the cost difference, the PC version of the game is the better deal, especially since the gameplay is better looking. But if you’re looking to take Skyrim on the go, or a Switch is your preferred gaming system, the price isn’t unreasonable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HBIvthh4-o2kkXUP5CB6pSTnyOE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW415460725-46d1960a611c4ea488515c19052068bf.jpg"                      alt="The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144275/7443" target="_top" id="2144275">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144275" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144275/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-action-RPGs"><a href="#Competition-Other-action-RPGs" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other action RPGs"></a><strong>Competition: Other action RPGs</strong></h2><p> The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim almost competes with itself, due to how many other versions of the game are available on other platforms. But if you’re looking for role-playing games specifically designed for the Switch, it would be worth looking at The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It was designed for the Switch from the beginning, sharing Skyrim’s action role-playing gameplay, but with crisp, beautiful graphics and smoother controls. If you’re interested in Japanese RPGs (JRPGs), it might also be worth looking into Xenoblade Chronicles 2, which will also share the same action-packed feel as Skyrim, but with a completely different graphics style and somewhat more complex combat and leveling.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Good if you want to play on the go.</strong></p><p> Even though The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a great game and the Switch is an amazing platform, our advice is only to buy Skyrim for the Switch if you’re looking to play on the go. Otherwise, we’d suggest purchasing Skyrim for the PC, where you’ll really be able to enjoy superior graphics and customization options.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review-4685759" >The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review-4688951" >Mario Kart 8 Deluxe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/splatoon-2-review-4688940" >Splatoon 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Nintendo Switch)</li><li>Product Brand  Bethesda</li><li>Price  $59.99</li><li>Available Platforms  Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-maximize-your-content-creation-top-rated-mac-mp4-slicers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Maximize Your Content Creation Top-Rated Mac MP4 Slicers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/10-excellent-web-based-screen-capture-solutions/"><u>10 Excellent Web-Based Screen Capture Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-recommendations-for-maximum-data-keep/"><u>2024 Approved Essential Recommendations for Maximum Data Keep</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/best-free-video-communication-apps-for-iphone-and-android-users/"><u>Best Free Video Communication Apps for iPhone & Android Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comparing-echo-pop-and-echo-dot-key-distinctions-unveiled/"><u>Comparing Echo Pop and Echo Dot: Key Distinctions Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-amazonbasics-micro-cut-shredder-12-sheets-reviews-and-ratings/"><u>Comprehensive AmazonBasics Micro-Cut Shredder (12 Sheets) Reviews & Ratings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/crafting-contrast-and-depth-in-hdr-portraits/"><u>Crafting Contrast and Depth in HDR Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/dissecting-facts-facebooks-impending-name-switch/"><u>Dissecting Facts: Facebook’s Impending Name Switch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-howtos.techidaily.com/effortlessly-resolve-the-issue-of-downloaded-files-being-removed-immediately/"><u>Effortlessly Resolve the Issue of Downloaded Files Being Removed Immediately</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/exploring-the-merits-of-urban-armor-gears-rugged-case-for-your-macbook-professional-device-an-expert-review/"><u>Exploring the Merits of Urban Armor Gear's Rugged Case for Your MacBook Professional Device: An Expert Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-effortlessly-uninstall-ebooks-from-your-ibooks-collection-the-three-superior-strategies/"><u>How to Effortlessly Uninstall eBooks From Your iBooks Collection: The Three Superior Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/overcooked-2-game-analysis-a-feast-of-fun-and-frantic-kitchen-action/"><u>Overcooked!

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> These days, when ISPs charge all kinds of exorbitant fees for hardware rentals, wireless modems like the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 are critically important. A modem can be an expensive initial purchase, but the money you save means it can pay for itself over time.</p><p> If you’re considering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cable-modems-to-buy-4082523" >purchasing your own modem <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you may have some questions. How much—if anything—are you going to have to give up to own your own modem? Will you get the same speeds? Will the wireless performance be up to snuff? And how will it look in your home?</p><p> We recently got the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 in for testing, so we can answer all of these questions and more. Let’s find out if this modem is worth the price of admission.</p><h2 id="Design-Lightweight-and-low-profile"><a href="#Design-Lightweight-and-low-profile" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lightweight and low-profile"></a>Design: Lightweight and low-profile</h2><p> For such a high-end modem, the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 is surprisingly thin and light. Compared to the Xfinity modem that we have lying around, it’s a huge improvement.</p><p> The Nighthawk C7000 is a black plastic device with an attractive modern aesthetic. There’s an array of LED lights on the front of the modem that inform you of its performance. Around the back, you’ll find a USB 2.0 port, four Gigabit Ethernet ports, a coax cable port, and the port for the power cord.</p><p> While this modem does have wireless capabilities, the antennae are inside the device, which makes for a more streamlined look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XBxyGD8RCZUzuy5c-9PSfLF4OBY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4082541-3-a9db59bb3f7a4f6aa4d7b1d852f4ee99.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk C7000"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130885/7443" target="_top" id="2130885">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130885" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130885/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><h2 id="Setup-Easy-for-a-modem"><a href="#Setup-Easy-for-a-modem" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Easy for a modem"></a>Setup: Easy for a modem</h2><p> Right out of the gate, it’s important to note that modems aren’t quite as straightforward to set up as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-modem-and-router-4159854" >your average router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We had to gather all of our ISP data—account number, username, etc.—before we could get started.

The Nighthawk C7000 comes with instructions for how to complete this setup.</p><p> For such a high-end modem, the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 is surprisingly thin and light.</p><h2 id="Software-Getting-the-job-done"><a href="#Software-Getting-the-job-done" class="headerlink" title="Software: Getting the job done"></a>Software: Getting the job done</h2><p> While the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 doesn’t have the richest software, it’s enough to effectively manage your network with little to no fuss.</p><p> After you log in and get the setup out of the way, you’ll be greeted by six tiles on the home page. Here you can click through to manage your cable connection and attached devices, set parental controls, and adjust your wireless settings. Netgear makes this easy to navigate and understand—even less tech-literate users should be able to handle everything from setup to security without getting too lost.</p><p> If you’re more of a power user and like to have precise control over your network, there’s also an “Advanced” tab where you can find in-depth information about your connection or set up dynamic DNS settings. These features likely won’t be relevant for most people using the Nighthawk C7000, but the options are there if you need or want them.</p><p> The Best Cable Modems Router Combos</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997722/19272" target="_top" id="1997722">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997722" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997722/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Everything-you’ll-need"><a href="#Connectivity-Everything-you’ll-need" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Everything you’ll need"></a>Connectivity: Everything you’ll need</h2><p> As far as physical ports are concerned, you get four Gigabit Ethernet ports and a USB 2.0 port. This isn’t the richest array of ports we’ve ever seen, but it should be fine for most people— we were able to connect a few different game consoles and a desktop.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk C7000 has three antennae built in, too. This means it has dual-band connectivity and a rated speed of AC1900, which can deliver up to 600 Mbps and 1,3000 Mbps on the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands, respectively. So, even with our extreme 250Mbps internet connection, the modem was able to keep up during even the busiest times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lQeMP8N7uIA0CjbxZqkH0q0LICU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4082541-2-8832c46a0891440caed03fdfb4ae3507.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk C7000"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100542/7443" target="_top" id="2100542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><p> This is thanks to the 24x8 DOCSIS 3.0 channel bonding. This means that it has 24 channels available for downstream data and eight for upstream data. That might sound like a lot of jargon, but it means that this modem is going to be overkill for the average user’s internet needs. Netgear claims that this modem can handle up to a 960Mbps connection, and we believe it. But if you don’t need this much bandwidth, you can pick up the 16x8 or 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 modem and save some cash.</p><p> Even less tech-literate users should be able to handle everything from setup to security without getting too lost.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148636/16836" target="_top" id="2148636">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148636" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148636/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-an-all-in-one"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-an-all-in-one" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for an all-in-one"></a>Performance: Great for an all-in-one</h2><p> Because this modem has a built-in router, we kind of expected the wireless performance to suffer. All-in-one devices, generally speaking, tend to perform worse than specialized equipment. That’s definitely true for the Netgear Nighthawk C7000, but we were pleasantly surprised by how well it performed considering it’s an all-in-one.</p><p> We tested this modem in a 2,500 square foot home, and we got reliable performance in every corner, only running into slowdowns on the farthest side of the house. Even then, network performance went down from about 230 Mbps to 130 Mbps. That isn’t super fast, but it’s still serviceable.</p><p> The wired performance, on the other hand, wasn’t quite as good. We were able to get a consistent 210 Mbps in most scenarios—which is more than enough for our typical usage—but even with a Cat7 Ethernet cable, we weren’t able to get our rated speeds.</p><p> We should also note that the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 doesn’t support<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or QoS capabilities, which is a disappointing omission in a device this expensive. However, we set up 6 different devices in our living room, all streaming HD video on YouTube. We then ran a speed test to see how it affected the network. We still got about 152 Mbps, even under all that stress. You won’t get full speed when everyone’s hitting the network hard, but it’ll still be serviceable.</p><h2 id="Price-A-premium-that’s-worth-it"><a href="#Price-A-premium-that’s-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: A premium that’s worth it"></a>Price: A premium that’s worth it</h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk C7000 is going to set you back $209, which might sound like a lot if you already have a modem set up. But take a look at your cable and internet bill and see how much you’re paying each month to rent a modem from your ISP. You won’t have to pay that anymore with the Nighthawk C7000. Over time, this device can actually pay for itself.</p><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-C7000-vs-Motorola-MT7711"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-C7000-vs-Motorola-MT7711" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk C7000 vs. Motorola MT7711"></a>Netgear Nighthawk C7000 vs. Motorola MT7711</h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk C7000 has plenty of competition—most notably the Motorola MT7711, which retails for $199. Not only does this Motorola modem have similar specs (24x8 DOCSIS 3.0 channels and AC1900 wireless capabilities), it also includes two phone ports. These ports are compatible with Xfinity’s phone service, so if you have a landline, you can use this modem for that, too. It’s a bit cheaper than Netgear’s modem, and it looks a little cheaper, too.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cable-modem-router-combos-to-buy-4082541" >The Best Cable Modem&#x2F;Router Combos of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Recommended for anyone with a fast broadband connection.</strong><br> The fact that this modem can pay for itself in time is really the main appeal. But with fantastic performance and good looks thrown in, the Nighthawk C7000 is a no brainer.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/netgear-c3700-cable-modem-router-review-4686094" >Netgear C3700 Cable Modem Router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/motorola-mg7700-review-4589346" >Motorola MG7700 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk C7000 DOCSIS 3.0 AC1900 Wi-Fi Cable Modem Router</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>Price  $209.99</li><li>Release Date  June 2015</li><li>Weight  1.6 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  9.66 x 8.31 x 1.7 in.</li><li>Speed  AC1900, 24x8 DOCSIS 3.0</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>Number of Antennas  3</li><li>Number of Bands  2</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  4</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  No</li><li>MU-MIMO  No</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li><li>Chipset  Broadcom BCM3384</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-ice-warriors-top-performances-at-2022-olympics-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ice Warriors Top Performances at 2022 Olympics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-premium-top-ten-nintendo-switch-fighter-games-max-156-for-2024/"><u>[New] Premium Top Ten Nintendo Switch Fighter Games (Max 156) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-financial-foresight-select-youtube-stocks-hubs-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Financial Foresight Select YouTube Stocks Hubs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-gear-for-tempo-tinkering-in-stories/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Gear for Tempo Tinkering in Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/command-line-game-boy-a-beginners-handbook/"><u>Command Line Game Boy: A Beginner's Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comparing-amazon-fire-tablet-and-ipad-choosing-the-perfect-device/"><u>Comparing Amazon Fire Tablet and iPad: Choosing the Perfect Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-ring-battery-doorbell-plus-evaluation/"><u>Comprehensive Ring Battery Doorbell Plus Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-the-value-of-chatgpt-plus-essential-reasons-for-joining-now/"><u>Discover the Value of ChatGPT Plus – Essential Reasons for Joining Now!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-poco-c50-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Poco C50? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/fx360-pro-from-id-cooling-exceptional-cooling-solutions-at-just-60-detailed-review/"><u>FX360 Pro From ID-Cooling: Exceptional Cooling Solutions at Just $60 – Detailed Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-android-without-mock-location-for-your-nokia-130-music-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Nokia 130 Music | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/outstanding-motorola-one-hyper-the-standout-mid-range-smartphone/"><u>Outstanding Motorola One Hyper - The Standout Mid-Range Smartphone!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/stay-connected-on-the-go-the-definitive-list-of-elite-wi-fi-travel-routers/"><u>Stay Connected on the Go: The Definitive List of Elite Wi-Fi Travel Routers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-strongest-signal-extenders-for-phones-2024-edition/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Strongest Signal Extenders for Phones, 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/transform-your-speech-the-7-top-vocal-changer-mobile-apps/"><u>Transform Your Speech The 7 Top Vocal Changer Mobile Apps</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798161/11305" target="_top" id="798161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798161/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126493/26400" target="_top" id="2126493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126493/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576474/17382" target="_top" id="1576474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576474/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047346/19272" target="_top" id="2047346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047346/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/c/5597632/1584040/17916" target="_top" id="1584040">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17916-1584040" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/i/5597632/1584040/17916"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135355/19272" target="_top" id="2135355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135355/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-gamers-guide-to-flawless-game-recordings-for-2024/"><u>[New] Gamers' Guide to Flawless Game Recordings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-leading-phones-gopro-editing-solutions-revealed/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Leading Phones' GoPro Editing Solutions Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-soundcheck-evaluation/"><u>2024 Approved SoundCheck Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-transfer-music-from-tecno-spark-10c-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>5 Ways to Transfer Music from Tecno Spark 10C to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/asus-rt-ac88u-under-review-a-game-changer-or-just-hype/"><u>Asus RT-AC88U Under Review -

The camera itself has a plastic, silver housing with a shiny silver focus ring on the end. It feels like it could break at any moment. The base is made of a transparent plastic, which is also available in blue and black. The plastic is so rigid that we expect it to break under regular use. Every time we adjusted the camera, the plastic creaked like a rusty door in a haunted house. Even in our short testing period, the joints started getting loose. We had to check several times just to make sure it wasn’t broken.</p><p> The base looks like a binder clip with a hinge on the back end. The front of the camera houses the focus ring, which twists to focus in or out but doesn’t turn very smoothly. When we used it for the first time, it didn’t feel like it was supposed to rotate at all. Just like everything else, the focus ring feels like it will crack or fall out at any moment. One side of the clip has a squishy pad to keep the camera from slipping when it’s mounted on a smooth surface. The two are connected by a ball joint, which allows the camera to spin around 360 degrees and tilt approximately 15 degrees forward or backward or side to side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a_8Gd66JN0RtfWzKKcRq95S8EmY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_6_Final_Horiz-1dd3a45479614483b0f4f5883f27094a.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Setup-process-Awkward-to-position"><a href="#Setup-process-Awkward-to-position" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Awkward to position"></a><strong>Setup process: Awkward to position</strong></h2><p> It takes almost no time to get the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel up and running. We just plugged the USB cord into the computer and it worked.</p><p> It was easy to set up when we clipped it to a laptop, but terrible when we tried to put it on our HD TV. Every time we moved the computer or the USB cable, the camera slid, twisted, or fell off the TV. The ball joint, which connects the camera to the base, didn’t move smoothly, so we struggled to point the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel in the right direction, and we were too worried about breaking the plastic to try and force it.</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that. We tested the resolution by taking photos through photobooth, and they were only 640 x 480, or .31 megapixels. We tested the video resolution by using an online webcam testing tool, and it showed exactly the same results. The manufacturer claims the camera has 38 times more resolution than it actually does. We should have known that the manufacturer’s claims were too good to be true given the $8 asking price, but claiming a disparity that huge is really brazen.</p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that.</p><p> We tested the camera’s field of view by placing it 13.5 inches from a wall and measuring the field of view, 8.25 inches. After running those measurements through some trigonometric calculations, we found that it has a 34 degree field of view. The camera also has a surprising amount of distortion. Vertical lines in the background had a significant tilt backwards, and we saw tremendous barrel distortion everywhere except for the very center of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BxI5asxQavdUO5cT3iIpSIqM9Mk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_10_Final_Horiz-8acc6be9290c439496f17a63684115ae.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1743243">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1743243.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1743243">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1743243.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Faligracehair.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1743243%2F19272'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1743243/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio"><a href="#Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio"></a><strong>Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio</strong></h2><p> We used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test out the video and audio performance using the webcam for recording and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-web-conferencing-tools-2377241" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It was difficult to position the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel correctly, because by the time we clipped it on and sat down, the camera had slipped out of position. This happened several times before we finally resigned ourselves to using a tilted camera in our calls.</p><p> The limited field of view and the distortions weren’t a problem when we tried a single-person call, but it would be a big problem for a group. It would be difficult to get everyone into the picture unless your table was very narrow and far away from the camera.</p><p> The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><p> We had trouble getting the focus right, too. The focus ring was hard to turn, so we had to put our hand over the lense to get a good grip. We turned the ring a little, and then we’d pull away to check the focus. Then we’d repeat until it was ready, a frustrating experience.</p><p> The audio performance of the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel was also lackluster. The built-in microphone produced poor quality sound, and when we tested it on Skype, voices were both muffled and echoey. People on the other end could understand what we were saying, but it was an unpleasant experience.</p><h2 id="Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam"><a href="#Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam"></a><strong>Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is the most inexpensive webcam you can buy, ranging from $8 up to around $15, but there’s a reason it’s priced so low. The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094418/7443" target="_top" id="2094418">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094418" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094418/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short"></a><strong>Competition: Falls short</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Logitech C270</em> :</strong> The Logitech C270 is a low-cost webcam that goes for $40 MSRP, though you can frequently find it for approximately $20. For $10 more than the Docooler, you get a big upgrade. It has 720p video calling and takes photos at 3MP. The microphone filters out background noise, so it shouldn’t have the same echo effects as the Docooler Web Cam. Even though it’s twice the price, you get a lot more camera for your ten bucks.</p><p><strong><em>HXSJ USB Webcam 480P HD</em> :</strong> We were most disappointed with the false claims about the Docooler webcam’s resolution, but HXSJ sells what looks like the same camera with honest advertising. In fact, the design, the frame, and just about everything else looks nearly identical to the Docooler webcam. Even the price is close to the same. We think the honest claims about the HXSJ should be rewarded, so we’d definitely recommend buying this camera over the Docooler.</p><p><strong><em>Coromose USB 50MP HD</em> :</strong> The Coromose USB 50MP HD looks exactly like the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, down to the last detail. The base and camera look exactly alike, even the writing on the focus ring, and they go for about the same price, $8. There is no way, however, that this camera can do 50MP. It’s the same camera saddled even more egregious, deceptive marketing.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Impossible to recommend.</strong></p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is one of the most inexpensive cameras on the market for a reason. This camera doesn’t come close to delivering what it promises, meaning it’s not worth even the trifle you’d pay for it.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  USB 2.0 12 Megapixel</li><li>Product Brand  Docooler</li><li>UPC  B00OB883F6</li><li>Price  $8.00</li><li>Weight  2.5 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.75 x 1.5 x 3 in.</li><li>Color  Transparent, blue, black</li><li>Connections  USB 2.0 A cord 56.25” long</li><li>Aperture  F&#x2F;2 - F&#x2F;4</li><li>Focus  Manual Focus 8mm to infinity</li><li>Field of vision  34 degrees</li><li>Resolution  640 x 480; 12 MP claimed, 0.31 MP tested</li><li>Frame rate  30fps</li><li>What’s Included  Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, Quick Start Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-clear-video-logger-for-windows-10-systems/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Clear Video Logger for Windows 10 Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-behind-the-scenes-crafting-confidential-snap-narratives/"><u>[Updated] Behind the Scenes Crafting Confidential Snap Narratives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/auditory-excellence-on-demand-the-top-6-mics-for-livestreams/"><u>Auditory Excellence on Demand The Top 6 Mics for Livestreams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-look-at-how-the-mohu-blade-enhances-tv-reception-unique-shape-and-powerful-interior-range-explored/"><u>Comprehensive Look at How the Mohu Blade Enhances TV Reception: Unique Shape and Powerful Interior Range Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/decoding-the-stars-an-in-depth-review-from-aminy/"><u>Decoding the Stars: An In-Depth Review From Aminy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-the-longest-range-wifi-solutions-on-the-market-2024-edition/"><u>Discover the Longest-Range WiFi Solutions on the Market - 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/dive-into-the-latest-fortnite-adventure-engaging-reviews-of-the-newest-season/"><u>Dive Into the Latest Fortnite Adventure: Engaging Reviews of the Newest Season</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/hard-resetting-an-vivo-v30-device-made-easy-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Hard Resetting an Vivo V30 Device Made Easy | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/learning-the-ins-and-outs-of-firefox-pip/"><u>Learning the Ins and Outs of Firefox PIP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/proven-techniques-for-captivating-online-audiences-via-zoom-and-youtube-live/"><u>Proven Techniques for Captivating Online Audiences via Zoom & YouTube Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/revolutionize-your-outdoor-adventures-with-romers-high-performance-rechargeable-spotlight/"><u>Revolutionize Your Outdoor Adventures with Romer's High-Performance Rechargeable Spotlight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/synchronizing-tweeted-videos-on-social-media-hub-fb-for-2024/"><u>Synchronizing Tweeted Videos on Social Media Hub FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-faceoff-exploring-pros-and-cons-of-apple-watch-series-9-vs-fitbit-charge-6/"><u>The Ultimate Faceoff: Exploring Pros & Cons of Apple Watch Series 9 vs Fitbit Charge 6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-your-console-nintendo-switch-lite-vs-nintendo-switch-oled/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Choosing Your Console: Nintendo Switch Lite vs Nintendo Switch OLED</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-xp-pen-artist-16-pro-drawing-pad-insights-and-reviews/"><u>Ultimate Guide to the XP-Pen Artist 16 Pro Drawing Pad - Insights & Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ling-the-art-of-valorant-thumbnail-creation-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling the Art of Valorant Thumbnail Creation on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The split layout of this particular keyboard can present a slight learning curve for users who need to be fluent touch typists, but it is easily one of the most comfortable and sleek keyboards available.</p><p> The keyboard has Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connectivity for either Windows or macOS and can reportedly operate for up to two years on a single pair of AAA batteries. The long battery life is undoubtedly a plus, but the lack of backlighting is a bit of a drag.</p><p> The K860 features an integrated wristrest that is among the most comfortable. While it does provide excellent support and is something of a necessity with ergonomic keyboards, the inability to separate the wrist rest from the keyboard itself could present a problem if it ever wears out, forcing you to buy a new unit altogether.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Membrane | <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wireless receiver, Bluetooth | <strong>RGB:</strong> None | <strong>Tenkeys:</strong> Yes | <strong>Palm Rest:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dedicated Media Controls:</strong> No</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424533">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424533">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424533%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424533/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Bluetooth"><a href="#Best-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Best Bluetooth"></a>Best Bluetooth</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/13215113" >Logitech K350 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vvGd6j3WPY7kvNcUe7rR9EtXw7Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/logitech-k350-wave-ergonomic-keyboard-with-unifying-wireless-technology---black-37ff3a8f592546ccb89727018658e217.jpg" >Logitech K350 Wave Ergonomic Keyboard with Unifying Wireless Technology - Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/13215113" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/13215113 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/13215113" >$50 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/keyboards/78012408?cid=us%253Acse%253Aqza7ob&source=connexity&channel=cse&adcampaign=CSE%255FConnexitycon&slpfid=3" >$40 at Lenovo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.adorama.com/lok350wk.html?slpfid=3" >$40 at Adorama.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Long battery life</li><li>Budget friendly</li><li>Low learning curve</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Occasional input lag</li></ul><p> The Logitech K350 is a good choice for anyone looking for a basic wireless keyboard with an ergonomic design.

Each key features a wave design that flows perfectly to the next, making long-term typing much more comfortable.</p><p> The keyboard also features a padded wrist rest and adjustable legs for comfort. The universal wireless receiver lets you connect mice and even other keyboards without using other USB dongles; great for computers where USB ports are at a premium.</p><p> The Logitech K350 uses two AAA batteries for power and can reportedly run for up to three years before swapping them out. The keyboard features dedicated media keys for streaming music and movies and fully customizable F keys to help streamline your workflow.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Membrane | <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wireless receiver | <strong>RGB:</strong> None | <strong>Tenkeys:</strong> Yes | <strong>Palm Rest:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dedicated Media Controls:</strong> Yes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137395/7443" target="_top" id="2137395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Macs"><a href="#Best-for-Macs" class="headerlink" title="Best for Macs"></a>Best for Macs</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NMVJYEW/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB00NMVJYEW" >Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FoNm5Ll0b-0S90PKTGIDqCTXM2Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kinesis-freestyle2-blue-wireless-ergonomic-keyboard-for-mac-9-standard-separation-ecab2805a4244eda85035c256af27749.jpg" >KINESIS Freestyle2 Blue Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard for Mac (9&quot; Standard Separation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NMVJYEW/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB00NMVJYEW" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NMVJYEW/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB00NMVJYEW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NMVJYEW/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB00NMVJYEW" >$99 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kinesis-KB800PB-us-Freestyle2-Ergonomic-Split-Keyboard-for-PC/41539324?slfpid=3" >$89 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/989638/Kinesis-Freestyle2-Ergonomic-Keyboard-For-PC/?cm_mmc=PLA-_-Google-_-Computer_Tablet_Accessories-_-989638&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIv7HKttKB6QIVUl8NCh2Afg94EAQYBCABEgJKIvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" >$113 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Extensive compatibility</li><li>Awesome battery life</li><li>Dedicated text edit macro keys</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Membrane keys</li><li>Split layout isn’t for everyone</li></ul><p> Apple computer users should look at the Kinesis Freestyle2 blue wireless ergonomic keyboard with a bevy of Apple-specific keyboard shortcuts, including cut, copy, paste, and undo. Connecting to your Apple machine via Bluetooth 3.0, a single battery charge on the Kinesis should last around 300 hours or six months (based on two hours per day of typing).</p><p> You’ll immediately discover that the negative slope design reduces the required extension of your wrist to hit each key. Available with three different channels, the Bluetooth-based functionality allows for three devices to be synced at one time (switching between the devices requires the single press of a key). Additional buttons include a shortcut for hiding (and showing) the dock and advanced multimedia playback and volume controls.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Membrane | <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wireless receiver | <strong>RGB:</strong> None | <strong>Tenkeys:</strong> Yes | <strong>Palm Rest:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dedicated Media Controls:</strong> Yes</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/freestyle2-blue-review-4780187" >Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac) Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07SXX7P6D/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB07SXX7P6D" >KINESIS Gaming Freestyle Edge RGB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/q3W8Bom-XJN_2to3Ie0pYQ79DRo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kinesis-usb-gaming-freestyle-edge-rgb-split-mechanical-keyboard-mx-blue-09e297410e95469492d64a80b1d35979.jpg" >KINESIS USB GAMING Freestyle Edge RGB Split Mechanical Keyboard (MX Blue) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07SXX7P6D/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB07SXX7P6D" >https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07SXX7P6D/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB07SXX7P6D <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07SXX7P6D/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB07SXX7P6D" >$199 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Freestyle-Edge-RGB-Split-Keyboard/523723147?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=6236" >$199 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fully customizable</li><li>Tenting stands available</li><li>Windows&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Linux compatible</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Reports of issues with SmartSet app</li><li>May be uncomfortable for those with larger hands</li></ul><p> Whether you’re a professional or hobbyist, gaming can take a toll on your wrists and hands. The Kinesis Freestyle Edge keyboard is here to keep you comfortable during all but the most intense gaming sessions. This keyboard has two separate pieces that can be placed in various configurations to feel more natural. The left section of the keyboard can be used on its own as a gamepad to make room for a larger mouse, microphone, or other equipment you may need. Both halves of the keyboard can be placed up to 20 inches apart for more comfortable typing and to make room for additional peripherals.</p><p> The keyboard features Cherry MX Blue switches for a clicky, tactile response and durability. Each of the 95 keys can be custom backlit with over 16.8 million color combinations and ten different effects. They can also be remapped on the fly with the SmartSet app, and up to nine other user profiles can be stored in the keyboard’s onboard 4MB memory. This keyboard features plug-and-play functionality for Windows, Mac, and Linux-based systems, so you don’t have to worry about downloading extra drivers or software.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Mechanical | <strong>Connectivity:</strong> USB | <strong>RGB:</strong> Per-Key | <strong>Tenkeys:</strong> Yes | <strong>Palm Rest:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dedicated Media Controls:</strong> No</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mice-for-macs-6753004" >The Best Mice for Macs of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068426/7443" target="_top" id="2068426">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068426" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068426/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-an-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-an-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in an Ergonomic Keyboard"></a>What to Look For in an Ergonomic Keyboard</h2><h3 id="Usage"><a href="#Usage" class="headerlink" title="Usage"></a><strong>Usage</strong></h3><p> Where will you be using this keyboard? Is it mainly for personal use, or will you take it to the office? Do you need an ergonomic keyboard explicitly made with gamers in mind? While you can use a keyboard for multiple purposes, you may enjoy customizing which one you buy based on how you will use it the most.</p><h3 id="Mac-vs-PC"><a href="#Mac-vs-PC" class="headerlink" title="Mac vs. PC"></a><strong>Mac vs. PC</strong></h3><p> Do you have a Mac or a PC? While it seems like keyboards should be usable with both, that’s not always the case. You need to make sure whatever keyboard you buy is compatible with your system (this is usually a bigger problem for Macs rather than PCs). Additionally, the two operating systems have slightly different keys. While you can often use mapping software to alleviate these issues, you may want to purchase a keyboard specifically designed for your type of machine.</p><h3 id="Keyboard-size"><a href="#Keyboard-size" class="headerlink" title="Keyboard size"></a><strong>Keyboard size</strong></h3><p> Do you need a full-size keyboard, complete with a number pad? If you’re inputting numbers, you probably find the number pad vital. But if you’re used to typing on a laptop, it’s likely you barely use it. Do you need a foldable, portable keyboard? Or do you need something with a small footprint but not necessarily mobile? You can find ergonomic keyboards in all sizes—think about what you’ll need.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-keyboard-wrist-rests-4172684" >The Best Keyboard Wrist Rests of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Do ergonomic keyboards really help?<br> While there’s not enough evidence available to establish that ergonomic keyboards can prevent RSI, carpal tunnel, or other ailments, they have been shown to reduce strain on the body by allowing for more natural angles and positioning while typing. That said, if you experience symptoms like numbness or nerve pain, you should immediately consult your doctor.</li><li>How does an ergonomic keyboard differ from a regular keyboard?<br> Ergonomic keyboards separate the standard keyboard layout into two halves. Splitting the keys in half roughly around the center of the keyboard allows the designer to tilt each half in a way that encourages a more natural hand and wrist position when addressing the keys, and reduces joint and muscle strain while typing.</li><li>How can you adjust to using an ergonomic keyboard?<br> If possible, start by using an ergonomic keyboard in much the same way you would a standard keyboard, to give your hands (and brain) time to adapt to the slight differences in key layout. Then, when you’re generally familiar with the new deck, start adjusting the keyboard to best suit your hands and typing style; many ergonomic keyboards will allow you to adjust not only the horizontal tilt of the separate halves but also the vertical lift. Find the angle and height that are most comfortable for your hands and seated position.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-full-breakdown-dji-inspire-2-analysis-for-2024/"><u>[New] Full Breakdown DJI Inspire 2 Analysis for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-master-mac-gif-archiver/"><u>[New] In 2024, Master Mac GIF Archiver</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-optimal-design-options-for-windows-users-no-cost-or-charged-for-2024/"><u>[New] Optimal Design Options for Windows Users - No Cost or Charged for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-what-are-the-different-versions-of-windows-movie-maker-in-2024/"><u>[New] What Are the Different Versions of Windows Movie Maker, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-video-capture-on-periscope-a-comprehensive-manual/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mastering Video Capture on Periscope A Comprehensive Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-precision-recorder-ads-free-edition/"><u>[Updated] Precision Recorder - Ads-Free Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/action-filming-elevated-in-depth-review-of-sj-cam-s6-for-2024/"><u>Action Filming Elevated In-Depth Review of SJ-CAM S6 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-tp-link-re200-ac750-range-extender-examined-a-blend-of-value-and-performance/"><u>Budget-Friendly TP-Link RE200 AC750 Range Extender Examined: A Blend of Value and Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/crafting-sophistication-meets-convenience-a-comprehensive-look-at-the-michael-kors-mkgo/"><u>Crafting Sophistication Meets Convenience: A Comprehensive Look at the Michael Kors MKGO</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/evolution-in-tech-analyzing-differences-between-samsungs-s23-ultra-and-s21-ultra/"><u>Evolution in Tech: Analyzing Differences Between Samsung's S23 Ultra and S21 Ultra</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/expert-evaluation-of-philips-somneo-premier-alarm-clock-assessment/"><u>Expert Evaluation of Philips Somneo: Premier Alarm Clock Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/m4amp3wavmp4top4/"><u>M4Aファイルから無料でMP3、WAV、MP4への変換ツールTOP4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/mastering-your-options-a-detailed-comparative-analysis-of-every-ipad-available/"><u>Mastering Your Options: A Detailed Comparative Analysis of Every iPad Available</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/practical-guide-utilizing-your-dell-monitor-top-tier-noise-canceling-headphones-and-exceptional-quality-webcam/"><u>Practical Guide: Utilizing Your Dell Monitor, Top-Tier Noise-Canceling Headphones & Exceptional Quality Webcam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-extraordinary.techidaily.com/schnelle-kostengunstige-migrationen-fur-windows-7-zu-ssds-verwandeln-sie-ihre-daten-in-eine-hochleistungslosung/"><u>Schnelle, Kostengünstige Migrationen Für Windows 7 Zu SSDs: Verwandeln Sie Ihre Daten in Eine Hochleistungslösung</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-troubled-journey-of-pixel-slate-through-a-messy-chromeos-landscape/"><u>The Troubled Journey of Pixel Slate Through a Messy ChromeOS Landscape</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-pc-applications-stuck-or-crashing-master-fixes-and-techniques-guide-of-2024/"><u>Troubleshooting PC Applications Stuck or Crashing?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Rexing V1 DashCam is a great choice if you’re in the market for a security-style dashboard camera. Its size and shape are more suited to windshield mounting than other models we tested, plus it captures high-definition footage, decent sound, and is an overall reliable device.</p><p> It has all the additional features you’d expect from a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/types-of-dash-cameras-534889" >dashcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , like loop recording and crash detection, and even some unique ones like timelapse recording. If you’re in the market for a dashcam, the Rexing V1 is definitely worth considering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JfL4E5NnuBPl6-93Hv3PI4IJsV0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_05-bcfff5f440b545378c9ee4e6b431ffac.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037318/7443" target="_top" id="2037318">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037318" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037318/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield"><a href="#Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield" class="headerlink" title="Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield"></a><strong>Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 Dashcam has a more distinctive form factor than other models we reviewed. Unlike many popular dashcam models, the V1 doesn’t resemble a point-and-shoot camera that hangs from your windshield. Rather, it’s angled to fit the curve of the glass. This makes for a more integrated, smooth look.</p><p> And it’s not just looks that make the design appealing. The fact that it’s not a simple square allows easier access to the control panel, improves the viewing angle of the display, and makes navigating the already-simple interface a bit easier.</p><p> There’s only one way to install this camera in your car, and that’s via a mount that sticks to your windshield with an adhesive strip. Fortunately, this works really well and the mount stays in place—throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it. And once the camera was installed on our windshield, it was very easy to slide it on and off the mount.</p><p> Throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it.</p><p> At just 2.7 inches, the display on this dash cam is the smallest among the devices we tested, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. All the icons, menus, and video footage itself are perfectly visible up close. And you probably don’t want to be paying attention to the screen while you’re behind the wheel, anyways—the at-a-glance view of the camera’s status is all you need.</p><p> It also has an internal accelerometer that can detect the impact of an accident, as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the necessary equipment to use the GPS feature—if you want to enable these, you have to buy the<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Rexing-GPS-Logger-V1-V1P/dp/B01AKH377A/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4770571%7Cn9eae1cd5706347139b8b83241f9d42ea10%7C" >Rexing GPS Logger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> separately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ztn3EsFqtKkWImvQhtgcr1vlHwI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_02-9ee3aa46e7394a1ab263a6b12b287314.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it</strong></h2><p> For those concerned about the hassle of installing a dashcam, don’t worry. The user manual for the Rexing V1 was the clearest and most detailed of all the dashcams we tested. The instructions are written in easy-to-understand language, and every button, feature, and tool is explained in detail so there’s no guesswork when you turn the device on.</p><p> Attaching this dash cam to your windshield is easy. Simply pull the plastic off the double-sided adhesive on the mount and stick it where you want it to go. However, you should be very careful when you’re doing this and make absolutely certain that you want it where you put it the first time. After a few seconds of being attached, it’s on there for good, and it takes a decent amount of ingenuity and elbow grease to get it off. Once it’s off, you can’t reapply it.</p><p> One of the things we appreciated about this dash cam is that it includes a 32GB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you won’t have to put out extra cash to get one. However, there is no microSD card adapter, so if you want to review your footage on a computer you’ll have to buy one of those.</p><p> Also included in the box is a special tool that helps you hide the power cable. To prevent the wire from hanging down in front of your windshield, you need to wedge it up under the edge of the roof and through the side panels (the instruction manual shows you the best route to take). It may seem complicated at first, but this whole process only took us about ten minutes to accomplish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/df0_L-UzAk3OryqSCncsjfqi8QM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_03-2273fff3f71944368711b60f5da9687e.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094422/7443" target="_top" id="2094422">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094422" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094422/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Basic"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Basic" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Basic"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Basic</strong></h2><p> You can set this dash-mounted camera to capture footage in either 720p or 1080p resolution, which is pretty limited. Similar dashcams can capture footage up to 2560 x 1440 resolution, with others going all the way up to 4K. However, if all you’re looking for is a simple security device, 1080p will do just fine.</p><p> When we reviewed the footage captured by the Rexing V1, we found it to be highly detailed and clear when the car was moving along city streets. However, when we hit the freeway, the picture became a little less clear. Signs were hard to read unless you stopped the recording, and small details such as license plates and bumper stickers on other cars couldn’t be made out at all. Nevertheless, the videos yield a good picture of what happens when you drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9_1pHoEq74JWPJ8reothv8PeI8E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_04-c5d42af8ddfa4296a6c6b1e8551edef6.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918719/19272" target="_top" id="1918719">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918719" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918719/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it"><a href="#Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Set it and forget it"></a><strong>Performance: Set it and forget it</strong></h2><p> During our testing, we took the Rexing V1 on several lengthy drives through the cities and countryside of northern Utah. In the week that we had it, we never had a problem with how it functioned. It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving. This is one of those devices that embodies the “set it and forget it” mentality.</p><p> This dashcam uses loop recording, which means that it is continuously recording while your car is on, but splices it up into manageable bits rather than one long file. Rexing recommends setting this to three minutes, but you have options to set it to five- and ten-minute intervals as well. When your memory card fills up, the device automatically overwrites the oldest files.</p><p> It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving.</p><p> This dashcam is also equipped with an internal accelerometer that gives it the ability to detect a traffic accident. When it senses that an incident has occurred, it automatically locks the video for that time to prevent it from being overwritten. This is a common feature among the dash cams we tested, but it works well and is a great way to protect yourself if you ever need to prove what happened in an accident.</p><p> One feature that is unique to the Rexing V1 is time-lapse recording. It is turned off by default and Rexing recommends you keep it off for your day-to-day driving. But if you’re taking a road trip with scenic routes or want to record a particular journey, this feature is fun to have.</p><p> Like the rest of the dashboard cameras we tested, the Rexing V1 has the ability to record audio, but it does a middling job of it. Voices in the car and sounds coming from the interior speakers were clear enough to understand, but sounds from outside the vehicle were muddy at best.</p><h2 id="Price-A-good-value"><a href="#Price-A-good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A good value"></a><strong>Price: A good value</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 retails for $130, but as of the time of this writing, can typically be purchased for closer to $100. We feel like this is a perfectly appropriate price for this device—it falls right in the middle of the typical dashcam price range, providing better performance than super budget models, but without the high-tech features of the more expensive options out there. In short, it’s a good price for a solid, basic device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137413/7443" target="_top" id="2137413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137413/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1"><a href="#Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1"></a><strong>Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1</strong></h2><p> If you’re wondering if you want to pay the extra $25 or so for the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam (which retails for $125), the decision will come down to form factor and image quality—everything else is pretty much the same.</p><p> The Z3 Plus is square and hangs from your windshield from a suction cup, so it can stick out like a sore thumb. The V1 doesn’t have that problem since it’s angled to fit your windshield, but the adhesive tape that holds it on is one-time-use only. If you make a mistake when installing it, you may end up wishing for the Z3’s clunky suction cup design.</p><p> If the Rexing V1’s 1080p resolution is good enough for you, there’s no need to put down extra cash for more pixels. The video is definitely high-res enough to use as a security device, and can effectively capture an accident or other incident. But if you want great video footage that you’ll enjoy watching in the future, an extra $25 isn’t too high a price to pay.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It delivers on what it was designed to do, without any extras.</strong></p><p> There isn’t much to complain about with the Rexing V1 DashCam. Its innovative form factor combined with a wide array of video capture features and decent picture quality means you won’t have any buyer’s remorse if you choose this dashcam.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123512" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  V1 DashCam</li><li>Product Brand  Rexing</li><li>MPN  REX-V1</li><li>Price  $99.99</li><li>Weight  14 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.6 x 4.9 x 2.8 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Display Type  LCD</li><li>Recording Quality  Up to 1080p</li><li>Night Vision  No</li><li>Connectivity Options  MicroSD, USB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-hashtags-that-elevate-your-channels-visibility-and-value/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Hashtags that Elevate Your Channels' Visibility & Value</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/bluehost-hosting-services-breakdown-testing-the-waters-of-cloud-vps-and-shared-plans/"><u>Bluehost Hosting Services Breakdown: Testing the Waters of Cloud, VPS, and Shared Plans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/calls-on-nubia-z50-ultra-go-straight-to-voicemail-12-fixes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Calls on Nubia Z50 Ultra Go Straight to Voicemail?

The Nintendo Switch isn’t generally a visual powerhouse, but its game catalog is often vibrant, cute, and gorgeous on the right screen.</p><p> Playing games on the Switch OLED felt a bit more exciting. It might only be a visual improvement, but games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Wonder deserve to be presented in the best possible light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JW7hKEf91vIUGcKyO4x2xMI4paw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchLiteandSwitchOLED2-7589f20a94af406bb9df98aaaa23cd19.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite and Switch OLED gaming consoles."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111964/7443" target="_top" id="2111964">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111964" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111964/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> After upgrading from the Switch Lite to the Switch OLED, I replayed games to see how prettier they looked.</p><p> Due to the lack of a dock, you’re also dependent on connecting to the internet via Wi-Fi only when using a Switch Lite, compared to the Switch OLED, which has an Ethernet port. Similarly, there’s no way to connect the Switch Lite via HDMI, so you won’t be able to stream games from it.</p><p> The Switch OLED also has 64GB of internal storage compared to 32 GB on the Switch Lite, but in both cases, you can upgrade the storage with microSD cards.</p><h2 id="Flexibility-Advantage-OLED"><a href="#Flexibility-Advantage-OLED" class="headerlink" title="Flexibility: Advantage OLED"></a>Flexibility: Advantage OLED</h2><p> The most significant difference between the Nintendo Switch OLED and the Switch Lite is its flexibility.</p><p> The Switch Lite is solely a portable gaming device. It works brilliantly for that, as I found when playing through many games while bedridden while recovering from surgery.</p><p> It’s very light to hold and isn’t too bulky, even for smaller hands. That’s why it’s particularly appealing to children, further helped by its plasticky shell, which feels like it can handle a few accidental drops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oxjDIc3a44xGYBV83bA1QcvlmXE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchOLED-074355b02db54dd1bb3e701d5674a9cb.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch OLED gaming console."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> The Nintendo Switch OLED is bulkier but can connect to your TV via the dock. Doing so lets you play multiplayer games once you unhook the Joy-Con controllers and gives you a bigger-screen experience compared to the Switch Lite.</p><p> Only one person at a time can play the Switch Lite, and you can’t detach the controllers, which means certain games won’t function with the Switch Lite—at least not unless you use separate Joy-Con controllers.</p><h2 id="Switch-Lite-Limited-Games"><a href="#Switch-Lite-Limited-Games" class="headerlink" title="Switch Lite: Limited Games"></a>Switch Lite: Limited Games</h2><p> The Switch Lite is helpful if you want a games console to use while traveling or to hand to your kids before a long journey.</p><p> However, if you plan to play games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on your TV for the whole family to join in, you’ll need the Switch or Switch OLED.</p><p> I tried playing multiplayer games on the Switch Lite by connecting a spare pair of Joy-Con controllers, but it’s a frustratingly small screen to do so.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TmYyOgzBYexzwHM_D35w2XJF68c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchLite1-33b6996f36534d1da9974a460e6c5139.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite gaming console."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> The Switch Lite is not compatible with the following games:</p><ul><li>1-2-Switch</li><li>All Just Dance games</li><li>Super Mario Party</li><li>Fitness Boxing</li><li>Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm &amp; Exercise</li><li>Ring Fit Adventure</li><li>Nintendo Switch Sports</li><li>Nintendo Labo (all sets)</li></ul><h2 id="Final-Thoughts-Each-Model-Has-Its-Advantages"><a href="#Final-Thoughts-Each-Model-Has-Its-Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts: Each Model Has Its Advantages"></a>Final Thoughts: Each Model Has Its Advantages</h2><p> There’s no bad Nintendo Switch console.

It’s the cheapest way to play Switch games, but you won’t easily play other games with someone sitting next to you.</p><p> The Nintendo Switch will suffice if you plan on exclusively connecting it to your TV so you can play with friends and family easily or enjoy a bigger-screen experience.</p><p> There’s no need to pay for a superior screen if you plan to use your TV the whole time.</p><p> The Switch OLED’s screen is superior to an LCD one and is comfortable enough to complete large games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim without connecting it to the TV.</p><p> However, it’s helpful to connect it to the TV to play games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the family or when you want to take in more of a game.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a

The AC2200 part of the name means it can deliver 2.2Gbps of bandwidth at once (<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-is-network-performance-measured-817422" >we’ve got an explanation of what that means here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), which is enough to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830" >stream Netflix in 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , video chat on FaceTime, and maintain a competitive edge in online games, on several devices all at once. Realistically, your internet connection won’t be this fast, but if you pay extra for a super fast connection, it’s worth considering that this unit will support it.</p><p> It’s designed to plug directly into a wall socket and supports a WPS push-button setup, making it really easy to set up and use. It doesn’t have an outlet pass-through, so it takes up one outlet but leaves the other free.</p><p> If you have any devices that don’t have Wi-Fi, this extender also has you covered there.

It doesn’t have the range or speed offered by many of the other extenders on this list, but it’s a great option if you need a little extra range to connect a handful of wireless devices.</p><p> The ideal scenario for this extender is expanding a spotty wireless network into a guest room or home office where you expect to connect only a few devices at a time. It can provide a maximum of 1,000 square feet of coverage and handle about enough bandwidth to stream in 4K, video chat, and download big files on a couple of devices at once without a lot of slowdowns.</p><p> If you have smart home devices that have trouble connecting to your network, this extender can help with that as well. Smart home devices require a connection to your network, but they don’t use up a lot of bandwidth.</p><p> This extender has a small size to go along with its low price, and it’s designed to be plugged directly into a power socket. It leaves the top outlet free for your other electronics, but it does use up the bottom one as it doesn’t have a pass-through. It does include a single Ethernet port, which makes it an excellent option for your home office if you have a computer that doesn’t support Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA2 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC750 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> No |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> No |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 1</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qWA7Ox2xug77GF1kfsRkFpHJ7pY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetgearEX3700Wi-FiRangeExtender-ce6ea0cfc4594cd98752d9cfdf86c0d6.jpg"                      alt="Netgear EX3700"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Scot Braswell</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/netgear-ex3700-wifi-range-extender-ac750-review-4589551" >Netgear EX3700 Wi-Fi Range Extender (AC750) Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006955/19272" target="_top" id="2006955">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006955" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006955/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Wi-Fi-6"><a href="#Best-Wi-Fi-6" class="headerlink" title="Best Wi-Fi 6"></a>Best Wi-Fi 6</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TP-LINK-RE505X-AX1500-Wi-Fi-6-Range-Extender/157871510" >TP-Link Wi-Fi 6 Range Extender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qqDW3g6zStY0103AH7g0GMr2z_8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/tp-link-ax1500-wifi-extender-internet-booster-wifi-6-range-extender-covers-up-to-1500-sqft-and-25-devicesdual-band-up-to-15gbps-speed-ap-mode-wgigabit-port-app-setup-onemesh-compatiblere505x-4664346f34a649a380758e78f702629a.jpg" >TP-Link AX1500 WiFi Extender Internet Booster, WiFi 6 Range Extender Covers up to 1500 sq.ft and 25 Devices,Dual Band up to 1.5Gbps Speed, AP Mode w&#x2F;Gigabit Port, APP Setup, OneMesh Compatible(RE505X) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TP-LINK-RE505X-AX1500-Wi-Fi-6-Range-Extender/157871510" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/TP-LINK-RE505X-AX1500-Wi-Fi-6-Range-Extender/157871510 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TP-LINK-RE505X-AX1500-Wi-Fi-6-Range-Extender/157871510" >$72 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/TP-LINK-Wi-Fi-6-Range-Extender-Adapter-RE505X/315077077?slpfid=3" >$85 at Home Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.newegg.com/tp-link-re505x/p/0E6-002W-005Y7?slpfid=3" >$90 at Newegg.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Advanced Wi-Fi 6 Technology</li><li>Intelligent Signal Indicator</li><li>Can be used as a wired Access Point</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Optimal performance requires Wi-Fi 6 devices</li></ul><p> If you have a blazing-fast internet connection and want to buy all the latest gadgets and devices, then the TP-Link RE505X offers one key feature you need:<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Wi-Fi 6 is faster and more efficient than Wi-Fi 5, which allows more devices to connect at once without experiencing a slowdown.

It has four Ethernet ports for connecting devices via a cable—something you’ll ideally want to do for the best speeds for devices like a streaming TV or console.</p><p> It’s swift, but remember, you may not need or be able to use that extra speed.

The TP-Link RE650 is a range extender that emphasizes range, with a maximum coverage area of up to 2,800 square feet. It also has plenty of bandwidth and supports beamforming for robust connections.</p><p> This is an excellent extender to choose if you need to extend Wi-Fi to a busy part of your house or if you have a large house with several rooms needing simultaneous coverage because it can handle a lot of data simultaneously. That makes it a good fit for covering a family room or busy home office with many devices connected at once. It also has a single Ethernet port, which is great for connecting a computer or game console.</p><p> While the TP-Link RE650 is powerful and lets you extend your Wi-Fi over a large area, it’s also straightforward to use and set up. It uses an app-based setup procedure that walks you through the process with on-screen prompts and even includes a signal indicator to take all the guesswork out of choosing where to install the extender. That means you don’t need to worry about trying to get the best connection, even if you don’t have much network experience.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA2 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC2600 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 1</p><h2 id="Best-Powerline"><a href="#Best-Powerline" class="headerlink" title="Best Powerline"></a>Best Powerline</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/netgear-powerline-ac1000-wi-fi-access-point-and-adapter-white/4760605.p?skuId=4760605" >Netgear PLW1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oSXrbuVxINsVbft5lO4_77pxavM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netgear-powerline-1000-mbps-wifi-80211ac-1-gigabit-port---essentials-edition-plw1010-100nas-f57f8dd376e84581902889cedf2cc47a.jpg" >NETGEAR PowerLINE 1000 Mbps WiFi, 802.11ac, 1 Gigabit Port - Essentials Edition (PLW1010-100NAS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/netgear-powerline-ac1000-wi-fi-access-point-and-adapter-white/4760605.p?skuId=4760605" >https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&amp;publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnetgear-powerline-ac1000-wi-fi-access-point-and-adapter-white%2F4760605.p%3FskuId%3D4760605 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/netgear-powerline-ac1000-wi-fi-access-point-and-adapter-white/4760605.p?skuId=4760605" >$80 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Powerline technology offers extended range</li><li>Includes Gigabit Ethernet port</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Performance is dependent on quality of home electrical wiring</li></ul><p> Most range extenders work by capturing the Wi-Fi signal from your main router and rebroadcasting it, but that isn’t always possible. If you’re trying to extend Wi-Fi to part of your home where brick walls or appliances block the signal, then a powerline extender like the Netgear PowerLINE 1000 can solve your problem.</p><p> The Netgear PowerLINE 1000 sends a network connection through the electrical wiring in your house to an adapter, which creates its own Wi-Fi network at the other end. Devices that connect to the network are then connected to your main router through the electrical wiring in your house. It supports up to 1Gbps of bandwidth, which makes it a good solution for spreading a Wi-Fi signal to a small home office or guest bedroom where a connection would otherwise be impossible.</p><p> In addition to creating a remote Wi-Fi network that connects back to your router through the electrical wiring, the PowerLINE 1000 also includes an Ethernet port for connecting a smart TV, game console, or computer that doesn’t support Wi-Fi. You can add up to 16 adapters to the system to bring wired and wireless connectivity to different parts of your home.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA2 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC1000 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> No |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> No |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 1</p><h2 id="Best-Portable"><a href="#Best-Portable" class="headerlink" title="Best Portable"></a>Best Portable</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5RCZQH?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4043312%7Cn8f2a58e80eec4ac08678f4a92a94a7d414%7CB01N5RCZQH" >TP-Link TL-WR902AC Travel Router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ArV5tOwnzCe518DefjvO-ZxkX28=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/tp-link-tl-wr902ac-ac750-travel-router-2af13e816a1946e2b9970ece13257baa.jpg" >TP-Link TL-WR902AC AC750 Travel Router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5RCZQH?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4043312%7Cn8f2a58e80eec4ac08678f4a92a94a7d414%7CB01N5RCZQH" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5RCZQH?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4043312%7Cn8f2a58e80eec4ac08678f4a92a94a7d414%7CB01N5RCZQH <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5RCZQH?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4043312%7Cn8f2a58e80eec4ac08678f4a92a94a7d414%7CB01N5RCZQH" >$34 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/381365375" >$34 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1322916-REG/tp%5Flink%5Ftl%5Fwr902ac%5Fac750%5Fwireless%5Ftravel%5Frouter.html/" >$40 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Dual-Band Wi-Fi</li><li>Solid Performance</li><li>Versatile with five wireless modes</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Not ideal for a large number of Wi-Fi devices</li></ul><p> The TP-Link TL-WR902AC is a travel router that’s small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Its primary purpose is to provide a strong Wi-Fi signal on the road, but it can pull double duty at home as a portable Wi-Fi extender.</p><p> This router tips the scales at about 8 ounces. It’s also powered through a micro-USB port, so you don’t need to pack a special power adapter. It will run off just about any USB power supply, like your phone charger or a portable power pack.</p><p> This extender’s range and bandwidth are on the low end, meaning it doesn’t extend Wi-Fi very far, and you can’t connect too many devices simultaneously. It has plenty of bandwidth to stream in 4K if you have a fast-enough internet connection, and portability is the more significant concern if you’re trying to stream Netflix in a hotel. Then, when you get home, you can also use it to boost the Wi-Fi signal in your house.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) | <strong>Security:</strong> WPA2, Guest Wi-Fi Secure Access | <strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC750 | <strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band | <strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> No | <strong>Beamforming:</strong> No | <strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 1</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7kKuuIyfD30duxgd5jNyVnVEyyA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TP-Link-TL-WR902AC-Wifi-Extender-3-ba81405b8f1f42e3a9c6e53e9fb520b9.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link TL-WR902AC Travel Router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tp-link-tl-wr902ac-travel-router-5079165" >TP-Link TL-WR902AC AC750 Travel Router Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> Also known as Wi-Fi boosters, Wi-Fi range extenders extend your home or office network’s reach, allowing you to enjoy fast internet speeds no matter what corner you’re sitting in. They eliminate dead zones, especially for devices far from your router, and ensure uninterrupted phone calls, browsing sessions, and anything you go online for.</p><p> We use three criteria to evaluate any Wi-Fi range extender purchase: range&#x2F;coverage, design, and security features.</p><p><strong>Range&#x2F;Coverage</strong></p><p> Arguably, the number one criterion for evaluating Wi-Fi range extenders is range. Prioritize Wi-Fi range extenders supporting Wi-Fi 6, which offers the latest data transfer standards by tapping into technologies like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) for improved performance over longer distances. We also prefer Wi-Fi extenders with a single high-gain antenna or multiple antennas supported by beamforming, which better “amplifies” Wi-Fi toward the direction of your supported devices.</p><p> Kudos to any device with Ethernet ports for wired connectivity, allowing a more stable connection across all your devices.</p><p><strong>Design</strong></p><p> On top of a compact and sleek design, look for Wi-Fi range extenders with flexible placement options. Ideally, they carry an integrated power outlet or allow for second or third placement options on your wall or desktop. Additionally, check for strategically placed indicator lights that inform you about power, signal strength, and other essential performance indicators. To prevent overheating, look for ventilation channels or heat sinks. For better signal coverage, opt for adjustable external antennas over internal antennas for improved Wi-Fi signal fine-tuning.</p><p><strong>Security Features</strong></p><p> At a minimum, look for a Wi-Fi range extender that supports Wi-Fi 6, incorporating the latest encryption standards for improved protection against unauthorized access. As more and more devices become Wi-Fi 6 compatible over time, you’ll also enjoy compatibility with future devices. Remember WPA2 encryption and automatic firmware updates for even greater leverage against potential security threats.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >The Best Long-Range Routers of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>How do you know if you need a Wi-Fi extender?<br> Do you have any “dead zones” in your house where the Wi-Fi doesn’t work or rooms where the signal is so weak your phone won’t stay connected? If you do, then a Wi-Fi extender can help bring the Wi-Fi from an area where it’s fairly strong to those areas where it doesn’t work very well. The best Wi-Fi extenders can even speed up your Wi-Fi connection in areas of your house where it’s weak and slow. Just keep in mind that Wi-Fi extenders are designed only to fill in one specific area. Think of it like your router creating a bubble of Wi-Fi, and then the extender creating a second bubble near the edge of the original one. If you’re having coverage problems in multiple areas in different parts of your home, you’ll need multiple extenders or a long-range router.</li><li>What causes Wi-Fi dead zones?<br> Think of your Wi-Fi signal like a radio playing- it gets quieter as it travels and goes through walls, doors, and floors. If you play music in one room, and then travel to the opposite side of your home or go downstairs to the basement, you may only be able to hear the music faintly (or not at all). When you turn the radio on, you can hear the sound with less interference on certain channels, and it may even play a bit louder on a specific channel. If you think of your Wi-Fi signal in the same way, you’ll realize it’s also going to weaken as it travels over longer distances, especially as it goes through doors, walls, floors, appliances, and other obstacles.</li><li>What is the difference between a Wi-Fi extender, a mesh Wi-Fi system and a Wi-Fi repeater?<br> In most cases, Wi-Fi extenders, Wi-Fi repeaters, and Wi-Fi boosters are all simply different names for the same type of device. All serve the same goal of increasing the range of your wireless network, although it’s important to keep in mind that not all Wi-Fi extenders work quite the same way or offer the same features. For example, while most Wi-Fi extenders connect to your main router over Wi-Fi, some connect through your home’s electrical wiring. So be sure to read the fine print and check the system requirements when picking a Wi-Fi extender for your particular needs. A<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh Wi-Fi system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also known as a whole-home Wi-Fi System. It uses a central router that connects to the modem and one or more satellite routers (or nodes) that all act as access points for the Wi-Fi signal. This way, you can place the different nodes around your home and extend your coverage far beyond the range you’d get if you only had a single router.</li><li>Do Wi-Fi extenders work with any router?<br> Unlike mesh Wi-Fi systems, Wi-Fi extenders are designed to work with almost any router, in much the same way as any other wireless device. If you’re concerned about performance, make sure the extender supports the same version of Wi-Fi as your router. For example, if your router supports Wi-Fi 6, getting an extender that supports Wi-Fi 6 will provide the best experience.</li><li>How big an area will an extender cover?<br> In the product’s description, you’ll often find a square footage amount that indicates the extender’s coverage range. If you opt for an extender, you can expect to extend coverage by about 1,200 square feet. If you purchase an extender with 1,200 square feet of coverage, that coverage is in addition to your router, so if your router provides 2,000 square feet of coverage, you can expect about 3,200 square feet of total coverage—assuming you place the Wi-Fi extender at the very edge of your existing router’s range. In most cases, you’ll likely end up with some overlap.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/additional-tips-about-sinnoh-stone-for-xiaomi-redmi-k70-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Additional Tips About Sinnoh Stone For Xiaomi Redmi K70 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/automate-your-furry-friends-diet-using-arf-smart-pet-feeders/"><u>Automate Your Furry Friend’s Diet Using Arf Smart Pet Feeders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/barking-bliss-a-game-for-pets-and-owners/"><u>Barking Bliss: A Game for Pets & Owners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/first-impressions-and-full-experience-with-newly-launched-samsung-galaxy-budsplus/"><u>First Impressions & Full Experience with Newly Launched Samsung Galaxy Buds+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-are-reviews-on-merchandise-streamed-for-cash/"><u>In 2024, Are Reviews on Merchandise Streamed for Cash?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-enter-the-ispoofer-discord-server-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to enter the iSpoofer discord server On Apple iPhone 15 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-simulate-gps-movement-with-location-spoofer-on-huawei-nova-y91-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Huawei Nova Y91? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-oppo-f23-5g-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock a Network Locked Oppo F23 5G Phone?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/miniscreen-tape-snapshot-assessment-and-substitutes/"><u>MiniScreen Tape Snapshot Assessment & Substitutes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/navigating-the-future-a-guide-to-the-premier-intelligent-listeners-of-this-year/"><u>Navigating the Future: A Guide to the Premier Intelligent Listeners of This Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/slash-your-monthly-bills-with-these-7-budget-friendly-wireless-plans-of-2024/"><u>Slash Your Monthly Bills with These 7 Budget-Friendly Wireless Plans of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/start-your-wet-adventure-with-these-safe-camera-bundles/"><u>Start Your Wet Adventure with These Safe Camera Bundles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/streamline-windows-interactions-with-updated-astro-device-drivers/"><u>Streamline Windows Interactions with Updated Astro Device Drivers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-audacity-sound-issue-on-windows-11-os/"><u>Troubleshooting Audacity Sound Issue on Windows 11 OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unboxing-and-testing-the-bookbook-v2-top-grade-design-to-shield-your-macbook/"><u>Unboxing & Testing the BookBook V2 – Top-Grade Design to Shield Your MacBook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/zero-price-maximum-fun-quickmemes-101/"><u>Zero Price, Maximum Fun QuickMemes 101</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It explains the situation in Harran, the city where the game takes place. The game proper starts with a cut scene that shows you on a plane, about to parachute out. There’s no character creation here, although once you get a little further into the game, you’ll be able to pick your clothes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/P3rXmBBI1GdQfgi0vVT9xKcFw90=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-2-db5990d1f64341eaae79e22a71bb8f95.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship"><a href="#Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship"></a><strong>Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship</strong></h2><p> The initial cutscene starts with you on a plane, preparing to jump. Your name is Kyle Crane, and you’re an undercover operative. You’ll parachute to the earth while your boss explains your mission―to find a stolen file―but the second you hit the ground, things don’t go as planned. You’re attacked and forced to fire your weapon to scatter your attackers. Of course, in zombie-infested Harran, a gunshot is zombie bait. Suddenly they’re swarming toward you and things look very dire, until you’re rescued by a pair of strangers, a man and a woman. The man dies saving you but you and the woman escape. Her name is Jade, and she’ll play a big role throughout the story as you try to win her and her brother’s trust.</p><p>Harran is a whole different city at night.</p><p> You’re a spy sent in to infiltrate this group of survivors by the Global Relief Effort or GRE, but now that they’ve saved your life, you start to feel like you owe them. They’ll send you on missions to prove yourself, such as setting up traps for air raid supply drops or battling the hostile bandits that prowl Harran’s streets. Throughout the game, you balance accomplishing the GRE’s task with serving the best interest of this group of survivors you find yourself increasingly attached to.</p><p> This is a fairly linear game with regards to the plot. There’s a main storyline for you to follow, with some optional side quests that you can take or leave. The narrative does a decent job of building up the circumstances for Kyle feeling torn between his mission and these people, and you’ll learn more about the virus as you go, as well as Antizin, the fictional drug that could lead to a cure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8G35q3VsoSEuht_3bqsGm0Pwz-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-7-d9d2bbe8881e476f8dfb3c13059634ed.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore"><a href="#Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore"></a><strong>Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore</strong></h2><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour. Other zombie games focus on having slow zombies you can run away from, or dumb zombies you sneak past, but Dying Light takes a completely different approach. Instead, the basic zombies are fast and almost always know where you are―but they can’t climb or jump. This means you can stay safe by leaping between rooftops, running up ramps, balancing across bars, etc. The parkour feature is the biggest thing that makes Dying Light unique in an oversaturated genre, and also part of what makes the game so much fun. It’s entertaining to cross the city running as fast as you can without pausing, challenging yourself to get from point A to point B without ever touching the ground.</p><p> If you do happen to find yourself on the ground with a few zombies around you, you’ll have a variety of weapons you can smash a zombies head in with. The game focuses mainly on melee, with occasional firefights with other bandits. The melee weapon system has an upgrade system that involves fusing together found materials. The melee combat is solid, and your swings connect in a satisfying way.</p><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour.</p><p> There are quite a few different types of zombies, and more are introduced the longer you play. There are runners who can parkour right along beside you, frog-men zombies that spit acid, and hulking beasts that swing giant sledgehammers. It’s this variety that keeps the gameplay fun―until night falls.</p><p> Harran is a whole different city at night. If you aren’t in a safe zone, you’ll quickly learn that running through the city at night is terrifying, specifically because of a zombie type called volatiles. Volatiles are crazy strong, super-fast, and will chase after you relentlessly until you get out of sight―not an easy thing to do when you’re freaking out. It can be a real rush to try to do a mission at night, so if things aren’t feeling tense enough for you, just wait until the sunsets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YctEePpYKsIXQ5kU-hQ8w7o9CDo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-4-1edeaf05c6ba435e9b81e68a13831ac6.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> The graphics of Dying Light compare well to other triple-A titles, though it feels like the developers took more care with the scenery than the characters. Human models look a little plasticky, but the world around you is textured beautifully and rich with small details like posters and graffiti that help make the world around you feel real.</p><p> Character animation is also excellent, and the buildings and other objects within the world offer a variety of ways to jump, climb, and crawl. The open urban landscape of Harran allows players to decide how they want to explore, acquire materials, and fight. You’ll be able to come at certain locations from a variety of angles,and it’s this sense of freedom and attention to the environments that brings Dying Light together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sy9NHLj8JNe2eaeS9HJJdejt6QE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-6-56ef808272b544e6a1038f4a5d0280f1.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151866/7443" target="_top" id="2151866">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151866" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151866/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend"></a><strong>Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend</strong></h2><p> On PlayStation 4, you can purchase the game for $14, a fantastic value. You’ll get more than enough gameplay and fun to justify a purchase at that low cost. However, if you want to play on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll have to either wait for the game to go on sale, or you’ll have to pay $40. Considering the game is older now, we’d suggest getting the game on sale (it goes on sale often through Steam). There’s a lot of fun to be had in Dying Light, especially if you have a friend to play with, so if you’re thinking about getting the game, we’d say go for it.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other zombie and parkour games"></a><strong>Competition: Other zombie and parkour games</strong></h2><p> There are a lot of other zombie survival games out there, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’d recommend them if you liked Dying Light. You might consider Days Gone, another PlayStation 4 zombie apocalypse game set in an open world, but if the parkour was the main attraction, you might look into the game Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. The game follows a girl in a sci-fi world and features first-person parkour running and fighting. Instead of the rough and gritty world of Dying Light, Catalyst takes place in a sleek futuristic dystopia that’s all glossy chrome and burnished glass.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An original in the zombie survival genre.</strong></p><p> Dying Light is a game that took an overdone trope and used it to create a fresh game. Its fun parkour and co-op gameplay make for a great gaming experience, particularly when shared with friends. The variety of zombie enemies combined with the excellent melee combat keep the experience fresh even in the late game―and if things feel too simple, doing a mission at night is a wholly different experience from daylight outings. Dying Light is a great game in the zombie survival genre that we would recommend to most players.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997695/19272" target="_top" id="1997695">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997695" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997695/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Dying Light</li><li>Price  $14.00</li><li>Available Platforms  PC (Steam) Playstation 4 Xbox One OS X Linux</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-designing-dynamic-podcast-engagements/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Designing Dynamic Podcast Engagements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-stardews-successors-top-10-farming-sim-picks/"><u>[Updated] Stardew's Successors Top 10 Farming Sim Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/a-guide-poco-m6-pro-5g-wireless-and-wired-screen-mirroring-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Guide Poco M6 Pro 5G Wireless and Wired Screen Mirroring | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/compact-and-convenient-the-revolutionary-foldable-bluetooth-keyboard-by-moko/"><u>Compact and Convenient: The Revolutionary Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard by MoKo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/elevate-your-tech-savvy-with-gpt-assisted-fixes/"><u>Elevate Your Tech Savvy with GPT-Assisted Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/final-act-finesse-hitman-3-game-review/"><u>Final Act Finesse: Hitman 3 Game Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-identify-some-outdated-hardware-drivers-with-windows-device-manager-in-windows-11-and-10-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>How to identify some outdated hardware drivers with Windows Device Manager in Windows 11 & 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/how-to-prevent-search-bar-spontaneity-in-windows-11/"><u>How to Prevent Search Bar Spontaneity in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/leading-psp-ios-game-simulators-our-2023s-choices/"><u>Leading PSP iOS Game Simulators - Our 2023'S Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/nikon-z7-review-a-top-tier-mirrorless-that-gets-nearly-everything-right/"><u>Nikon Z7 Review: A Top-Tier Mirrorless That Gets Nearly Everything Right</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/now-subtract-3-from-both-sides-to-isolate-the-term-with-x-3x-plus-3-3-6-3-which-becomes-3x-9/"><u>Now, Subtract 3 From Both Sides to Isolate the Term with X: $3X + 3 - 3 = -6 - 3$, Which Becomes $3X = -9$.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/pureview-revive-mend-mp4-and-mov-files/"><u>PureView Revive: Mend MP4 & MOV Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/sony-ps-lx310bt-compact-classics-reimagined/"><u>Sony PS-LX310BT: Compact Classics Reimagined</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-secrets-to-a-free-spotify-education-plan/"><u>Unlocking the Secrets to a Free Spotify Education Plan</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s easy to use, robust, and has some great monitoring tools.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> I’m a fan of the Apple Watch for the most part, but my time with the Garmin Forerunner 265 has made me realize I need to switch things up when I’m running, especially when I want to be serious about my running aims.</p><p> It works with both my iPhone and Android phone with a simple-to-figure-out app. There’s a battery life of about 14 days, too, so I hardly ever needed to remember to recharge it.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lots of key stats for runners</li><li>Dedicated training plans</li><li>Body battery feature lets you know if you need rest</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Not stylish in the slightest</li><li>Slightly uncomfortable to wear</li></ul><p> Crucially, the Garmin Forerunner 265 is a great aid when running. It offers information on seemingly everything from pace and speed to your averages, your cadence, how much power you’re pushing through your legs, and so forth. It also has many training plans that you can simply pick out and follow without needing to sign up for any additional services.</p><p> The Garmin Forerunner 265 keeps you on track outside of your training sessions. As any avid runner will know, a marathon or half-marathon plan is just as dependent on rest days as it is on active running.</p><p> The Garmin Forerunner 265 is effectively like having a personal trainer on your wrist.</p><p> That’s where the Garmin Body Battery feature is hugely useful. It gives you a score each day so you can see how far you can push things or whether you should be resting. Based on your heart rate variability, stress levels, sleep quality, and how active you’ve been, I’ve found it fairly accurate. Combined with a plan that reminds you to rest, it’s effectively like having a personal trainer on your wrist.</p><p> It’s not the most stylish of watches, but the Garmin Forerunner 265 is fantastic for pure running.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, Tom’s Guide, The Verge, and Trusted Reviews strongly recommend the Garmin Forerunner 265.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Forerunner 265 has 277 ratings from Amazon customers. 85% of those gave it five stars, with another 6% giving it four stars for an overall average of 4.6 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Also-Great"><a href="#Also-Great" class="headerlink" title="Also Great"></a>Also Great</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SUUNTO-Dual-Band-Touchscreen-Training-Insights/dp/B0CFT1CC3J?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0CFT1CC3J" >Suunto Race GPS Sports Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rMMOguoEFoyPIXnHr8NMWtxSqdM=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SuuntoRaceGPS1-9c858a97203d4694af5090e8195587ea.jpg" >Suunto Race GPS Watch. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SUUNTO-Dual-Band-Touchscreen-Training-Insights/dp/B0CFT1CC3J?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0CFT1CC3J" >https://www.amazon.com/SUUNTO-Dual-Band-Touchscreen-Training-Insights/dp/B0CFT1CC3J?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0CFT1CC3J <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SUUNTO-Dual-Band-Touchscreen-Training-Insights/dp/B0CFT1CC3J?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0CFT1CC3J" >$449 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> One of the more stylish running watches, the Sunnto Race has a great display for glancing at while you race.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Sunnto Race is a bit big on my slender wrist but it still looks good. It has an incredibly crisp display that I found instantly likeable as I ran. I might not run fast but it’s still useful to quickly glance at how you’re doing.</p><p> There aren’t many great pre-loaded digital watch faces but what’s there is classy even if not as much fun as something like the Snoopy watch face on my Apple Watch Series 9. Best of all is its Digital Crown which is something that isn’t a surefire thing on running watches in particular.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Gorgeous display</li><li>Feels classy and expensive</li><li>Offline map support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Little sluggish to respond</li><li><strong>Garmin has better insight</strong></li></ul><p> It’s easy to scroll through the options with my preference being to check how my training progress is going and when to rest. The Suunto way of doing things isn’t as detailed as the Garmin method but it’s still more than good enough and in exchange, you get a watch that you’re more likely to want to wear on an evening out rather than solely when running.</p><p> In my time with it, the Sunnto Race had a near flawless GPS although heart rate monitoring reported a little higher than on other devices although that could be down to its placement on my wrist.</p><p> Instead of Garmin training plans, you get Suunto Coach which still helps you not overload yourself while training, but it does feel a little slower to get going than other watches. Similarly, starting an exercise takes a brief moment which is simultaneously not the end of the world but does soon grate a teensy bit.</p><p> The Sunnto Race has fantastic battery life–up to 26 days. Even with GPS running the whole time, you’ll get about 40 hours.</p><p> On a much more positive note, however, the Sunnto Race has fantastic battery life, at up to 26 days, depending on how you use it. Even with GPS running the whole time, you’ll get about 40 hours, which will suit ambitious ultra-marathon runners and more. There’s extensive offline map support, too, which is great at this price.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Road.cc, TechRadar, UltraRunner Magazine, and Tom’s Guide all recommend the Sunnto Race.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Suunto Race has 91 ratings from Amazon customers. 66% of those gave it five stars, with another 12% giving it four stars for an overall average of 4.1 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/c/5597632/1838960/17916" target="_top" id="1838960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17916-1838960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/i/5597632/1838960/17916"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0C7GGYS7M" >Amazfit Balance Smart Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1Cr0cF5dqi9WoAWH6Ov8NwRcPW4=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazFitWatch3-613ee42b11c0405b90d777d657a47f94.jpg" >AmazFit Balance Watch. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0C7GGYS7M" >https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0C7GGYS7M <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0C7GGYS7M" >$230 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> More affordable than most running watches, the Amazfit Balance looks good and covers the basics, even if it does falter in places.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1006793/11832" target="_top" id="1006793">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1006793" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1006793/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Amazfit Balance looks fantastic. It’s one of the more stylish watches I’ve used and while a little chunky on my small wrists, feels like something to wear to an event as well as while running. One button on the right offers a shortcut to whatever workout you’re thinking of doing while the Digital Crown is there for interacting with the many apps that are preinstalled.</p><p> A lot of these are filler material but I appreciated the meditation app. There’s a body measurement app too but like many others (including those on pricier models), this won’t really compare with a good pair of smart scales. It’s nice insight though.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Surprisingly lightweight</li><li>Looks great</li><li>Reasonably accurate</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Not as robust as some</li><li>Body measurement tools can be inaccurate</li></ul><p> The bright and crisp screen is perfect while you run. There’s no convoluted data here so at a glance, I could see exactly how fast I was moving. The only annoyance was how as standard, the watch’s voice assistant will read out your progress which can be awkward if you’re running past someone and didn’t realize it would do that (from harsh experience!).</p><p> There’s no fancy Gorilla Glass here but when running, I’m not really planning on scraping my arm alongside a rough surface so this is only really an issue if you also plan on strength training or rock climbing.</p><p> The Amazfit Balance might lack some finer details but it still squeezes in a daily readiness reading which felt akin to what Fitbits have provided in recent times. It’s not as detailed as something like Garmin’s Body Battery tool but it felt reasonably accurate when I compared it to how I was feeling.</p><p> Away from the watch, the Zepp companion app is a little confusing to use but certainly packed with functionality so it’s worth exploring.</p><p> Ultimately, the Amazfit Balance won’t compete with the big guns but it’s considerably cheaper than those options. If you’re looking for compromise, the Amazfit Balance gets the balance right.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Wired, Livescience, and ZDNet all recommend the Amazfit Balance.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The AmazFit Balance has 220 ratings from Amazon customers. 68% of those gave it five stars, with another 18% giving it four stars for an overall average of 4.5 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148129/17093" target="_top" id="2148129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2148129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148129/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-We-Test"><a href="#How-We-Test" class="headerlink" title="How We Test"></a>How We Test</h2><p> I reviewed each running watch based on the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Setup</li><li>Daily use</li><li>How easy they were to use mid-run</li><li>Looks</li><li>Battery life</li></ul><p> I purchased the Apple Watch Series 9 for personal use, and the respective companies loaned me the Garmin Forerunner 265, Suunto Race, Amazfit Balance, and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</p><p> I used all the devices for a number of weeks with some being used for many months.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The best jump starters blend portability with reliability. Most importantly, it needs to resurrect your car, every time, as quickly as possible (and with minimal hassle). On the other hand, for all the times you’re not in an emergency situation, it needs to tuck neatly away in your car, and not hog a ton of valuable real estate. To find out just how well the DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter struck this balance we purposefully drained a car’s battery and got to work testing.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case"><a href="#Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case" class="headerlink" title="Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case"></a><strong>Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case</strong></h2><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case with a relatively durable zipper holding the two sides of the case together. One side contains the unit itself within a foam insert, and the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. The idea here is that you can keep the case stashed in your trunk or under a seat and have everything you need.</p><p> The unit itself is a surprisingly small red and black brick, constructed out of plastic that feels both rugged and yet somehow also soft to the touch. There’s a flashlight on one end of the unit that is mounted flush within the case and on one corner of the case there’s a compass; presumably for the times where you get really lost. All the device’s inputs, outputs, the display, and the on&#x2F;off switch are found on one of the longer sides. No cables stick out from the unit itself, as you must use one of the accessories to enable the device to do any of its actual work.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> The accessory kit contains a wall charger and a 12V port charger for the unit, a DC cable, and a variety of ends to allow for charging a laptop. The jumper cables sprout from a module that plugs into a specific port on the unit and terminate in your standard clamps. The module itself has a status light that illuminates to indicate the unit’s readiness to jump start the car.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use"><a href="#Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use"></a><strong>Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use</strong></h2><p> It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car. You plug the jumper cable module into the unit, which will cause its module light to flash green, then connect the red clamp to the positive terminal on your car’s battery and the black clamp to the negative terminal which will cause the module light to illuminate solid green. With our test vehicle it was a little difficult to get the clamps on the negative terminal as they are a little large, and the cables themselves are on the short side. With the clamps in position all that is left is to start the car and remove the clamps in reverse order.</p><p>It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car.</p><p> If it’s other devices that need power, you simply need to turn the unit on and then plug them into the appropriate port. For a laptop, that means you must pick the correct adapter, use the power button to switch the unit to the right power mode for your laptop, and plug it into the DC power port. For a phone or other USB device you pretty much just need to pick one of the two ports and plug in, though the smart port provides better amperage and faster charging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road"><a href="#Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road"></a><strong>Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road</strong></h2><p> When it comes to its ability to provide power, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter doesn’t disappoint. It reliably started a 2011 Hyundai Elantra that had a battery depleted down to 10V with zero issues, multiple times. With as small as it is, we did have some (thankfully unfounded) concerns that the unit might slide down into the engine bay as soon as the engine started.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> Charging USB devices is not only simple but fast as well, with a sustained 1,200 mAh current. This level of charging will top off your devices in a hurry, and with 18,000 mAh capacity the unit should be able to charge a phone like the Samsung Galaxy S10 five times over. Be aware that if your phone uses a USB-C or Thunderbolt connection you’ll need to provide your own cable.</p><h2 id="Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass"><a href="#Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass"></a><strong>Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass</strong></h2><p> Small as it’s, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter has a few extra features of note. The flashlight built into the case is decent, but doesn’t put out much light and does so within a relatively narrow angle. However, with as small as the unit is, you can easily just hold the whole thing in your hand like a flashlight to illuminate whatever you need.</p><p>It packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><p> As mentioned before the case does have a compass on it, which is a curious addition to a tool such as this. It’s quite small and is neither illuminated nor does it glow in the dark. We suppose it might be useful to get your bearings in an unfamiliar area, but chances are decent you’re just going to get the car jump started and get back on the road instead.</p><p> Speaking of which, one method of charging the device is through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >your car’s 12V power port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This means that you can pop the hood on a car with a dead battery, get it jump started, and then use the running car to charge the jump starter as you drive to your next destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter"><a href="#Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter" class="headerlink" title="Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter"></a><strong>Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter</strong></h2><p> You can find this model available online for between $70 and $75, and at that price point it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size. There are other units that are a little less expensive, but generally at the expense of some features or included accessories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135417/19272" target="_top" id="2135417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135417/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you"><a href="#Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you"></a><strong>Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Beatit BT-D11:</em></strong> The two units are so similar in their design and production that it really boils down to one question: How important is charging your laptop to you? If it’s worth the extra $10, stick with the DBPOWER 600A. If not, you can pick up the Beatit BT-D11 for a bit less money and otherwise get a strikingly similar unit.</p><p><strong><em>Aickar Car Jump Starter:</em></strong> Between these two it’s almost too close to call.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> With over 250 million players, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is a third-person shooter that has taken the world by storm—and for good reason. Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144283/7443" target="_top" id="2144283">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144283" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144283/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148127/17093" target="_top" id="2148127">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2148127" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148127/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141676/17091" target="_top" id="2141676">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141676" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141676/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50).

Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play. So, if you have the time, why not try both?</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fun, fast-paced battle royale that’s rightfully taken the world by storm.</strong></p><p> Fortnite has taken the world by storm, and with over 250 million players worldwide, it’s easy to see why it’s so beloved. If you’re a fan of campy fun, vibrant graphics, third-person shooters, or battle royale games, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is well worth a look—and best of all, it is free to play. Combined with Epic Games’ continuous ability to reinvent Fortnite season after season, Fortnite Battle Royale a sure-fire winner in our books.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080342/19272" target="_top" id="2080342">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080342" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080342/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Product Brand  Epic Games</li><li>Price  $29.99</li><li>PC Minimum Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel HD 4000</li><li>PC Recommended Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core Core i5 2.8 Ghz, Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Mac Minimum Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel Iris Pro 5200</li><li>Mac Recommended Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i5 2.8 Ghz,Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Platforms  PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch</li><li>Languages Supported  English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin America, Spain), Turkish</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-building-your-digital-identity-start-a-youtube-channel-today/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Building Your Digital Identity Start a YouTube Channel Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-2023s-premier-action-cameras-for-ocean-thrills/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved 2023'S Premier Action Cameras for Ocean Thrills</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-optimal-settings-for-recording-movs-on-windows-11-systems/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Optimal Settings for Recording MOVs on Windows 11 Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streaming-services-app-investigation-findings/"><u>2024 Approved Streaming Services App Investigation Findings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/7-top-ways-to-resolve-apple-id-not-active-issue-for-apple-iphone-6s-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>7 Top Ways To Resolve Apple ID Not Active Issue For Apple iPhone 6s Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/echo-pop-vs-echo-dot-unveiling-their-distinctive-characteristics/"><u>Echo Pop Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Most<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wifi-extenders-4043312" >Wi-Fi extenders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are reasonably affordable devices that are pretty easy, straightforward ways to improve your existing home Wi-Fi situation. Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender takes on a different kind of philosophy. That’s reflected in the boosted price, certainly, but also the capabilities: this is the first Wi-Fi 6 extender on the market.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new standard that not only allows for faster maximum speeds than previous generations but also better accommodates the increasing pile of wireless devices that we have around our homes and connecting at any given time—from phones to laptops and smart home gadgets. Newer smartphones and laptops are implementing support for the standard, and new Wi-Fi routers are being released to supply those benefits.</p><p> If you don’t already have one of those new Wi-Fi 6 routers, should you spend extra for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 to futureproof your setup? Here’s what I think after testing the device for several days across everyday web usage, media streaming, playing online games, and more.</p><h2 id="Design-Pretty-awkward"><a href="#Design-Pretty-awkward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty awkward"></a><strong>Design: Pretty awkward</strong></h2><p> The Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is not only the largest and heaviest Wi-Fi extender I’ve tested at 10 inches tall and nearly two pounds, but it’s also one of the oddest-looking. It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward. Also, the little plastic feet don’t do a great job of supporting the weight, making it a bit wobbly on a flat surface.</p><p> With very large sides, the front is really just a small panel with light-up LED indicators showing connectivity details and which Ethernet ports are in use. There’s also a small WPS button beneath the LED panel for easy connectivity with a router. On the wider back panel are the four wired<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for plugging in devices such as game consoles and computers, as well as a USB 3.0 port, DC power port, and the power button itself.</p><p> It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Avoid the app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Avoid the app</strong></h2><p> The setup options for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 are the same as with Netgear’s other extenders—even those without Wi-Fi 6 support. You’ll begin with the extender plugged in near your router. If your router supports<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you can pair the extender with it easily by following the process listed in the included booklet, which is as simple as pressing a button on the router and then doing the same on the extender.</p><p> If that’s not an option, or you’d rather follow a step-by-step process with prompts, then you can set it up using either a mobile (iOS or Android) app or a web browser on your computer.</p><p> The mobile app has been unreliable in my experience with other Netgear extenders, but it was much worse when setting up the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The app repeatedly could not connect with the created mesh network on the extender during setup, and I had to factory reset the device multiple times to start again.</p><p> Over and over, the setup process wouldn’t complete… and then it finally did. I ran into similar issues with the other Netgear extenders, in which setup processes didn’t work as expected on the first or second time, but this was a much longer and more arduous ordeal. Finally, however, I got the Nighthawk AX8 up and running. From there, you’ll need to find a new location for the extender—roughly halfway between the router and your Wi-Fi dead zone is ideal, but play around with positioning if you’re not getting the results you seek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xru8JLL_UOk3sXBYpbrOyAl-ihc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_02-b120eab8816746338c53e4eb1cfc62d6.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006960/19272" target="_top" id="2006960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Smooth-sailing"><a href="#Connectivity-Smooth-sailing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Smooth sailing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p> Once through the hassle of setup, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender really did deliver strong performance. I tested the connection in my office, which reliably sees reduced 5GHz reception from my router due to obstructions in between, and saw a noticeable boost in both reception and speed.</p><p> In one test, I registered a 5GHz speed of 246Mbps with the extender, which was the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen anywhere in my house using that older, TP-Link router. Given that, I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The router isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, but I still saw higher top-end speeds than ever before.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender also performed pretty well in distance testing. In another instance, I registered a 5GHz download speed of 87Mbps with my office, and then measured the speeds from my backyard at approximate distance intervals from the extender.</p><p> I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8.</p><p> That 5GHz signal dropped down to 77Mbps at 25 feet, 74Mbps at 50 feet, and 56Mbps at 25 feet—still pretty speedy from the farthest edge of my property. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz signal started at just 42Mbps at that moment in my office, and dropped to 30Mbps at 25 feet, 28Mbps at 50 feet, and 26Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Given the high max speeds, it wasn’t surprising to see strong gaming performance, as well. While playing Rocket League, I saw smooth gameplay across the wired Ethernet connection as well as both wireless networks, with a ping as low as 33 via the wired connection. The wireless ping was only a few points higher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rtnI3hSe9qP5qFqjhu1LRxe7qYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_03-19da5fea4d0349ce984f52a11493d337.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135400/19272" target="_top" id="2135400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135400/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> As a Wi-Fi mesh extender, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 will automatically replicate the SSID of your router’s existing Wi-Fi networks and seamlessly keep you connected whenever you’re in range of either. That’s true even with non-Netgear routers and those without Wi-Fi 6 support, and it’s a huge benefit over some cheaper extenders that don’t keep the same network info intact across devices.</p><p> It’s billed as an “8-stream” device, so it should be able to handle several simultaneous media streams at once, with a billed max speed of 4.8Gbps on the 5GHz band and 1.2Gbps on the 2.4GHz band.

That’s definitely on the higher end for an extender.</p><p> Should you really spend that much on an extender? If you don’t already have a new Wi-Fi 6 router, then probably not. You might see higher peaks of speed as I did, but rather than trying to mix and match old and new tech, you’re probably better off investing in a new Wi-Fi mesh system that can cover the entire house. Netgear’s Orbi is a favorite, as is Google’s similar Nest Wi-Fi system.</p><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)</strong></h2><p> Both of these Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi extenders will set you back $200 or more, and the key difference between them—aside from design—is the Wi-Fi 6 compatibility of the Nighthawk AX8. The Nighthawk X6S (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Range-Extender-EX8000/dp/B074F3M2W8/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846125%7Cn35b11b2c61b54fa1a2d951691d1a61ed04%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have that, but it does deliver excellent 5GHz range and has four Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices. The Nighthawk AX8 is more future-proof as a result, but at a greater cost that becomes increasingly difficult to justify the higher, it climbs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Only for early adopters with Wi-Fi 6 routers and devices.</strong></p><p> If you’ve already bought a Wi-Fi 6 router and need a little help extending your signal into further corners of your home and&#x2F;or property, then the Nighthawk AX 8 (EAX 80) is the extender you’ll want. But if you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead. Spending more than $200 on an extender doesn’t make much sense unless you’re adding it to a top-of-the-line system—and don’t mind the significant investment.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk EAX80 AX6000 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  EAX80</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  10 x 7.75 x 4.2 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Ports  4x Ethernet, 1x USB</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-virtual-realms-at-your-fingertips-the-1-list-of-immersive-vr-streamers-for-pc-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Virtual Realms at Your Fingertips The #1 List of Immersive VR Streamers for PC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-galaxy-ford-f-150-rc-truck-evaluation-the-ultimate-guide/"><u>Comprehensive Galaxy Ford F-150 RC Truck Evaluation - The Ultimate Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-logitech-c615-camcorder-appraisal-balancing-quality-with-cost-efficiency/"><u>Comprehensive Logitech C615 Camcorder Appraisal - Balancing Quality with Cost-Efficiency</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/here-is-how-asmr-helps-with-sleep-and-best-asmrtist-recommendation-for-2024/"><u>Here Is How ASMR Helps with Sleep & Best ASMRtist Recommendation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-role-of-asmr-in-improving-mental-clarity/"><u>In 2024, The Role of ASMR in Improving Mental Clarity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-is-fake-gps-location-pro-and-is-it-good-on-lava-blaze-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, What is Fake GPS Location Pro and Is It Good On Lava Blaze 2 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/introducing-amazon-halo-a-revolutionary-and-intimately-insightful-health-monitor/"><u>Introducing Amazon Halo: A Revolutionary and Intimately-Insightful Health Monitor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/mastery-check-unpacking-the-features-and-efficiency-of-poweradd-pilot-pro2-laptopdevice-charging-dock/"><u>Mastery Check: Unpacking the Features & Efficiency of POWERADD Pilot Pro2 Laptop/Device Charging Dock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/quick-solutions-how-to-repair-airdrop-issues-with-our-top-16-fixes/"><u>Quick Solutions: How to Repair AirDrop Issues with Our Top 16 Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/ranking-top-10-srt-modifications-for-pc-and-macos-for-2024/"><u>Ranking Top 10 SRT Modifications for PC & macOS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/sx530-review-the-smart-simple-camera-for-photography-beginners/"><u>SX530 Review: The Smart, Simple Camera for Photography Beginners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-ios-15-adoption/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to iOS 15 Adoption</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Fitness trackers have come a long way over the last few years, and you can find options in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and price ranges. The Garmin Vivosmart 4 is priced in about the mid-range, and it offers a few cool perks in addition to the standards like calorie counting and step counting. I tested the Garmin Vivosmart 4 for a month to see how it performs compared to other similarly priced fitness trackers on the market.</p><h2 id="Design-You-can’t-remove-the-band"><a href="#Design-You-can’t-remove-the-band" class="headerlink" title="Design: You can’t remove the band"></a><strong>Design: You can’t remove the band</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart is lightweight, weighing only 16.5 grams (for the small&#x2F;medium size). It has a very slim profile, with the silicone band measuring only about a half of an inch in width. Now, this is great for style purposes, as the band looks great on the wrist. But, the slim design isn’t particularly functional, as the screen is extremely small and somewhat hard to read from a distance (especially if you have poor vision like me). The tiny screen measures a mere 0.26 inches wide by 0.70 inches tall.</p><p> The Vivosmart 4 has a unibody design, and you cannot remove the tracker portion from the band. I was somewhat disappointed to see that I couldn’t switch out the bands for other colors and styles, especially considering Garmin has such attractive band options. Unfortunately, you can only choose one—grey with rose gold trim, berry with light gold trim, azure blue with silver trim, or the band I tested, black with midnight trim. The band also comes in small&#x2F;medium or large sizes. The small&#x2F;medium size fit my wrist well, but when I had my husband try on the band, it wouldn’t fit around his wrist. Other trackers, like the Fitbit Charge 4, come with both a small and large band.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JsDCEVwOi6EK7WLcs2WJ03jOZb0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-3-ba9d18a527ae4b41a7242ffaccd1de30.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137378/7443" target="_top" id="2137378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-You’ll-forget-you’re-wearing-it"><a href="#Comfort-You’ll-forget-you’re-wearing-it" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: You’ll forget you’re wearing it"></a><strong>Comfort: You’ll forget you’re wearing it</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 is one of the more comfortable fitness trackers I’ve tested. Most of the time, I’d forget I was even wearing the tracker until it vibrated. The band’s side edges are rounded off, making it feel more comfortable against the skin.</p><p> The buckle doesn’t press into the skin or cause irritation, but the sides of the silicone band do leave indents on the wrist after long periods of wear. The Vivosmart 4 is waterproof, and you can wear it in the pool, wear it while showering, and in the rain without damaging the device. You really only have to take off the Vivosmart to charge the battery.</p><h2 id="Performance-Body-battery-and-stress-monitoring"><a href="#Performance-Body-battery-and-stress-monitoring" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Body battery and stress monitoring"></a><strong>Performance: Body battery and stress monitoring</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Vivosmart 4 performs exceptionally well in some areas and mediocre in others, making it a decent device for runners or everyday users who want a device to track their general health and wellness, but a not such great device for fitness buffs who want seamless and accurate workout tracking.</p><p> The Vivosmart 4 has some cool perks, like a pulse ox sensor that can track blood oxygen saturation levels, and a body battery feature that uses a variety of data (oxygen, sleep, heart rate, etc) to determine how much energy you have available. The body battery feature is perhaps the most useful tool within this tracker, as it lets you know when you need to take it easy and when you have more energy available to spend. There’s also a stress monitoring widget you can place right on the tracker’s interface, which I also found incredibly useful. I was in the process of moving while testing the Vivosmart 4, and I could watch my stress levels rising as I went through the stresses of packing, moving, and buying and selling my homes.</p><p> The body battery feature is perhaps the most useful tool within this tracker, as it lets you know when you need to take it easy and when you have more energy available to spend.</p><p> On the downside, the Vivosmart 4’s step counter isn’t exactly accurate, although this tends to be a common problem with fitness trackers. I also saw some issues with the accuracy of the heart rate monitor, as I tested the heart rate monitor against a chest monitor, and it was off by as much as 10 beats per minute.</p><p> Workout tracking is somewhat lacking in the Vivosmart 4. It has a feature called Move IQ, which is supposed to identify periods of movement that match familiar exercise patterns like walking, running, biking, swimming, or using an elliptical machine. It then automatically starts timing the event for you. This feature is only accurate some of the time though. It detects walking pretty consistently, but it doesn’t do as good of a job at detecting swimming or biking. For strength training, it has a rep counter, but you can also turn on auto-set, and the Vivosmart 4 will attempt to automatically determine when you’re performing a repetitive motion and estimate the number of reps. These features aren’t always accurate though, and you may have to go in and edit the data afterward.</p><p> I tested the heart rate monitor against a chest monitor and it was off by as much as 10 beats per minute.</p><p> Overall, the Garmin Vivosmart 4 is capable of providing an abundance of useful data, but it requires a bit more effort on the part of the user to obtain this information. If you do things like add a custom stride length, edit any activities that didn’t track accurately, track hydration and weight goals, use the female health features, and pair the Garmin Connect app with the My Fitness Pal app, you can get a comprehensive health and fitness tracking experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Fu0WY5D4aslVxU_cls1YqWYQBeg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-2-67ea15321c9541f1b57d5528302152fe.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030380/11832" target="_top" id="1030380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030380/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Software-Garmin-Connect-App"><a href="#Software-Garmin-Connect-App" class="headerlink" title="Software: Garmin Connect App"></a><strong>Software: Garmin Connect App</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 doesn’t have any hard buttons, but rather a monotone touchscreen that you double-tap on the bottom portion to awaken. You scroll up and down to navigate through the various functions. I’m not in love with the interface, which isn’t particularly intuitive or feature-rich. Although companion apps are important to any good fitness tracker, the Vivosmart 4 relies too heavily on its app. It doesn’t have built-in GPS either, so it’s more tethered to your phone than some other fitness trackers on the market.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-connect-course-creator-tool-1683347" >Garmin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Connect app is pretty comprehensive though. You can customize your widgets and choose up to six displayed activities. You can also enable smart notifications, which will send call and text alerts to your Vivosmart 4 or send all notifications. I made the mistake of selecting “all notifications,” and I received, well, all notifications (from my video doorbell, security camera, and shopping apps). I quickly changed the setting to receive notifications for calls and texts only.</p><p> The Garmin Connect app allows you to dive as deep into your fitness tracking as you want. If you’re a runner, it can track everything from your cadence to your max pace. It provides charts and graphs of your long term activity level, heart rate, stress, body battery, and more. You can also use insights to compare that data with the averages in your age and gender category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XmHmMYvuaOGE3gAGIsa_vChmpas=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-4-22ab906932be467bb2e3309e30555ab4.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Battery-May-last-a-full-seven-days"><a href="#Battery-May-last-a-full-seven-days" class="headerlink" title="Battery: May last a full seven days"></a><strong>Battery: May last a full seven days</strong></h2><p> The battery is supposed to last for up to seven days, but the battery life depends largely on the features you use and how frequently you use the tracker. If you’re only passively tracking a few metrics, your battery might last a full week. If you’re constantly checking your heart rate, pulse ox, stress levels, sleep, and counting reps several times a day, your battery will not last that long. I got three and a half days of battery life when taking full advantage of the fitness tracker’s features.</p><p> The battery charges using a clip-on charger. It took an average of 90 minutes to reach a full charge (from about 10% full).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886015/19272" target="_top" id="1886015">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886015" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886015/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Reasonable"><a href="#Price-Reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 retails for $130, which is slightly high for this unit. You can find a refurbished version on Amazon for around $80, which is a more reasonable price.</p><h2 id="Garmin-Vivosmart-4-vs-Fitbit-Charge-3"><a href="#Garmin-Vivosmart-4-vs-Fitbit-Charge-3" class="headerlink" title="Garmin Vivosmart 4 vs. Fitbit Charge 3"></a><strong>Garmin Vivosmart 4 vs. Fitbit Charge 3</strong></h2><p> I found the Garmin Vivosmart 4 much more comfortable than the Fitbit Charge 3. I also like the body battery and stress monitoring features in the Vivosmart 4. On the other hand, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-charge-3-review-5072527" >Fitbit Charge 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a more accurate heart monitor (according to testing). The Fitbit Charge 3 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTN21JL/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5072535%7Cn5f18362fc97d487e830fd6d6cfaf2af211%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) also offers a ton of workouts in its Fitbit app, and slightly more seamless activity tracking for weight training and high-intensity workouts. If you want a day-to-day fitness tracker to track your sleep, stress, and energy levels, the Vivosmart 4 is a great option. If you want a larger screen and easy tracking for activities like weight training and cycling, you may prefer the Fitbit Charge 3.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A comfortable band with unique perks.</strong></p><p> The Garmin Vivosmart 4 is a great option for anyone who wants to track their sleep, stress, energy, and cardio, but there are better options out there for weight training.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Vivosmart 4</li><li>Product Brand  Garmin</li><li>UPC  010-01995-10</li><li>Price  $130.00</li><li>Weight  4.8 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.38 x 5.75 x 2.95 in.</li><li>Lens material  Polycarbonate</li><li>Bezel material  Aluminum</li><li>Strap material  Silicone</li><li>Display size  0.26 x 0.70 inches</li><li>Resolution  48 x 128 pixels</li><li>Display type  OLED</li><li>Battery life  up to 7 days</li><li>Memory  7 timed activities and 14 days of activity tracking data</li><li>Sensors  heart rate monitor, barometric altimeter, accelerometer, ambient light sensor, pulse ox</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth Smart and ANT+</li><li>Compatibility  iPhone, Android (text response&#x2F;reject phone call with text (Android only)</li><li>Smart features  Smart notifications, connected GPS, weather, and more</li><li>Activity tracking features  Calories burned, floors climbed, and more</li><li>Gym and Fitness  Strength Training, Cardio Training, Elliptical Training, Stair Stepping, Yoga, Automatic Rep Counting</li><li>Other features  training, planning and analysis, heart rate, running, cycling, swimming, kids activity tracking</li><li>What’s included  Vívosmart 4 smart activity tracker, Charging&#x2F;data cable, Manuals</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-deep-dives-closer-scans-and-enhanced-gameplay-on-roblox/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Deep Dives Closer Scans and Enhanced Gameplay on Roblox</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-urban-oasis-creation-bridging-concrete-with-wildlife-habitats/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Urban Oasis Creation Bridging Concrete with Wildlife Habitats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevate-gaming-experience-through-perfect-recordings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevate Gaming Experience Through Perfect Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-hero5-black-pro-photography-and-cinematography-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Hero5 Black Pro Photography & Cinematography Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/breaking-down-the-features-of-chromecast-with-google-tv-vs-firetv/"><u>Breaking Down the Features of Chromecast with Google TV Vs.

As beautiful as it is on the outside, under the hood you also have a solid set of components with a 3.4GHz 7th generation quad-core Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 1TB Fusion Drive. Apple has managed to pack quite a bit of power inside the slender frame. We put it to the test to see how it fares for multimedia and productivity uses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TCcSm-nkER9HhHM8YIPMWbaezRA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-4-fa6cf253bfd44ab991c366691b68bdf5.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049370/7443" target="_top" id="2049370">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049370" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049370/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements"><a href="#Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements" class="headerlink" title="Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements"></a><strong>Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements</strong></h2><p> It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >beautiful machine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from top to bottom. Before even turning it on, the design of the computer a striking, aluminum-clad body that’s still subtle enough that it will blend in with nearly any office or home environment.</p><p> The tapered design makes the edges appear almost non-existent while its bulkier behind manages to round things out in a proportional manner. At its thinnest point — the edges — the iMac measures in at just 0.2 inches. On its integrated stand, the iMac measures in at 17.7 inches tall, 20.8 inches wide, and 6.9 inches deep. Amazingly, all of that weighs in at just 12.5 pounds, not including the keyboard and mouse.</p><p> Overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package.</p><p> Aside from the Apple logo on the front aluminum chin of the iMac, all of the connections and ports on the iMac are on the rear of the computer. This includes, left to right: a 3.5mm headphone jack, SD card slot, four USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 3.0 ports (USB-C), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and power adapter. There’s also a Kensington lock slot to let you secure the the iMac.</p><p> We would’ve liked to see a thinner bezel around the screen, as the one present on the iMac is about half an inch — much larger than even the most basic PC monitors. It’d be a bit different if Apple were doing more with that real estate, but as it stands, it feels like wasted space</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gM_JxuZjDbSUs7DYtXIwUIqqz0Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-3-d30c5f8414e94cbd9b1ec8aea9b18950.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151854/7443" target="_top" id="2151854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151854/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go"></a><strong>Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go</strong></h2><p> One of Apple’s core tenets is simplicity, and the 4K iMac is no exception to this rule. Inside the box is the computer itself and a box which contains the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. Additional components include the power connection for the computer, a Lightning cable for charging the mouse and keyboard, and a small package of documentation.</p><p> Setting up the iMac is as simple as unwrapping it from its protective cover, setting it on the desk, plugging it in with the included power cord, and pressing the power button. As it boots up, we turned on the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. By the time the iMac was to the setup screen — a process that took approximately 60 seconds — the two were already paired with the computer and ready to be used.</p><p> Going through the setup process took us approximately five minutes, which included setting up our iCloud account and getting the various login settings in place. We opted to set this up as a new computer, but there’s also the ability to set it up from an Apple Time Capsule backup or transfer content from a PC via USB. The amount of time those options take will vary depending on the device you’re transferring the information from as well as the amount of data being transferred.</p><h2 id="Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine"><a href="#Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine"></a><strong>Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine</strong></h2><p> With a resolution of 4096 x 2304 pixels, the 4K iMac has more than 9.4 million pixels and features a pixel density of 217 pixels per inch, more than enough to make individual pixels indistinguishable at normal viewing distances.

Unlike a traditional hard drive (HDD), which relies exclusively on spinning platters to write and read information, Apple’s Fusion Drive also adds a small solid state storage (SSD) partition. This is where the operating system and most critical applications are stored, as solid state memory is much faster than traditional HDDs. The result is a drive that offers some of the advantages of SSDs while still offering the more affordable price tag and capacity of HDDs.</p><p> In our tests, boot-up time ranged from 15 seconds to 25 seconds. Considering the hybrid-style Fusion Drive, this lines up with our expectations, falling right between SSD speeds and HDD speeds. The same held true with boot-up times for various applications, ranging from Safari to more resource-intensive applications such as Final Cut Pro.</p><p> Moving onto the CPU and GPU benchmarks, we tested the iMac with both Geekbench and Cinebench to see how well the 3.4GHz quad-core processor and AMD Radeon Pro 560 held up.</p><p> “Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac.”</p><p> In the Geekbench tests, the iMac scored 4,866 on the single core test, 14,151 on the multi-core test, and 56,974 on the OpenCL score. This falls in line with other iMacs of the same specifications and hovers around other computers with similar specifications. In Cinebench, the iMac achieved 93.86 frames per second in the OpenGL test and a score of 584 cb in the CPU test.</p><p> All-in-all, the iMac seems to punch right at or above its specifications when compared to similar hardware. It’s not going to be pumping out 8K footage, but for basic 4K video editing and image post-processing, the graphics card is more than enough. As for productivity, there’s not much you can throw at the iMac that it can’t handle. The only thing we noticed slowing down the computer was the 8GB of RAM when we had over a dozen applications open, but that can be fixed by upgrading to the 16GB or 32GB model (although it’s not a cheap upgrade).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027195/19272" target="_top" id="2027195">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027195" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027195/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Fast-and-reliable"><a href="#Network-Fast-and-reliable" class="headerlink" title="Network: Fast and reliable"></a><strong>Network: Fast and reliable</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac features both wired and wireless connectivity for internet access. As previously mentioned, the iMac features a Gigabit Ethernet (RJ-45) port on the rear of the computer for a hardwired internet connection. For Wi-Fi, the iMac uses an 802.11ac network adapter with support for IEEE 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n.</p><p> In our hardwired tests, the iMac maxed out our Gigabit fiber optic internet no problem, with steady download and upload speeds. Wireless connectivity was equally impressive, regardless of whether the iMac was in the same room as the router or a few rooms over. We didn’t notice any drops throughout our tests and both uploading and downloading content was consistent.</p><h2 id="Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks"><a href="#Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks"></a><strong>Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks</strong></h2><p> The only camera on the 4K iMac is the integrated webcam, which sits dead center above the display. We would’ve liked to see a 1080p or even 4K webcam included, but the 720p resolution is good enough for basic video messaging.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rFu0_k9BjbUxQdoEYOcNGU35LJA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-2-a3d2f38b9509480ba41bbb5b33815d1a.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Software-Everything-you-need-and-nothing-more"><a href="#Software-Everything-you-need-and-nothing-more" class="headerlink" title="Software: Everything you need and nothing more"></a><strong>Software: Everything you need and nothing more</strong></h2><p> As with all Apple computers, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac comes with macOS Mojave pre-installed. If you’re used to macOS as a whole, you’ll feel right at home as we did. Compared to past versions of macOS, Mojave improves in a number of areas, including an integrated Dark mode that turns much of the user interface dark grey to spare your eyes. There’s also a feature called “Stacks” that intelligently combines files of the same type on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Apple annually announces and subsequently releases a new operating system, free of charge, to install on Apple computers. In-between major releases Apple will also push out incremental updates, at least two of which we installed during our review process. These incremental installs can be done either manually within the System Preferences applications or be set to install themselves automatically when the computer is plugged in and powered on.</p><p> Unlike Windows, macOS doesn’t come with any bloatware either. There’s a number of pre-installed apps developed by Apple, including four new ones borrowed from Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, but most of the pre-installed apps are the standard array of programs you’d expect to see on any modern computer.</p><h2 id="Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real"><a href="#Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real" class="headerlink" title="Price: The Apple tax is real"></a><strong>Price: The Apple tax is real</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac we tested with the aforementioned specifications retails for $1,499. Compared to other Windows PCs with similar specifications, the iMac is without pricey for the specs it offers. However, this is par for the course with Apple, so much so that the term “Apple tax” has become a commonly-used phrase. What you’re paying for is the entire package, wrapped up in one of the best-looking frames out there.</p><p> Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac. If you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem and don’t need to shell out for the more expensive 27-inch 5K iMac, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is priced much more reasonably and still has plenty to offer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137226/26400" target="_top" id="2137226">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137226" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137226/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market"><a href="#Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A unique option in a small market"></a><strong>Competition: A unique option in a small market</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac has a few competitors in its specification range, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two: the Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO 700 and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.asus.com/displays-desktops/all-in-one-pcs/zen-aio/" >Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> All three all-in-one desktops feature 4K displays (or at least the option to order them with 4K displays). Aside from that, the specifications also line up similarly, with i7 CPU configurations, dedicated GPU options, SSD variations, and beefy memory choices.</p><p> Of course, the biggest difference between the three desktops is that the 21.5-inch 4K iMac runs macOS while the other two run Windows 10. Using Apple’s included Boot Camp program, it’s possible to run Windows 10 (and other operating systems) on the iMac, but macOS isn’t able to be run on the other devices.</p><p> Other differences include various connections options on the back of the computers and variations in size—most notably the iMac is quite a bit smaller in dimensions across the board. That said, the larger size allows easier access to internals which makes upgrading easier on the Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 700 and Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC.</p><p> Prices vary greatly between the three desktops depending on the configuration you’re looking for, but overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac seems to hold its own in this price range, despite Apple’s notoriety for being a little bit on the pricier side.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Beautiful display in a thin, powerful machine.</strong></p><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package. It’s not going to blow anyone away on benchmarks and it’s not cheap for the internal components you’re getting, but it has a lot to offer for multimedia and productivity. That’s not to mention the sheer convenience of having everything simply work out of the box.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-studio-2-review-4689102" >Microsoft Surface Studio 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r7-review-4689097" >Alienware Aurora R7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkcentre-m720-tower-review-4776238" >Lenovo ThinkCentre M720 Tower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iMac 21.5-inch 4K</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>UPC  190198085795</li><li>Price  $1,499.00</li><li>Weight  12.5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  17.7 x 20.8 x 6.9 in.</li><li>Platform  Windows 10 Home</li><li>CPU  3.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i5</li><li>GPU  Raden Pro 560</li><li>RAM  8GB</li><li>Storage  1TB Fusion Drive</li><li>Connections  3.5 mm headphone jack, SDXC card slot, Four USB 3 ports (compatible with USB 2), Two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, 10&#x2F;100&#x2F;1000BASE-T Gigabit</li><li>What’s in the box  21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display Magic Keyboard Magic Mouse 2 Power cord Lightning to USB Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-film-enhancements-15-best-luts-to-boost-gopro-cinematography/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Film Enhancements 15 Best LUTs to Boost GoPro Cinematography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-leverage-linked-profiles-to-amplify-fb-stories/"><u>[Updated] Leverage Linked Profiles to Amplify FB Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-perfect-your-tiktok-bio-how-to-add-an-effective-link/"><u>[Updated] Perfect Your TikTok Bio How to Add an Effective Link</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-helper.techidaily.com/automated-with-cookiebot-enhancing-your-websites-performance/"><u>Automated with Cookiebot: Enhancing Your Website's Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/compact-and-convenient-the-universal-folding-moko-bluetooth-typewriter/"><u>Compact and Convenient: The Universal Folding MoKo Bluetooth Typewriter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/compact-and-portable-tp-link-wr902ac-travel-router-your-on-the-go-wi-fi-solution/"><u>Compact and Portable TP-Link WR902AC Travel Router - Your On-the-Go Wi-Fi Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-capturecraft-in-depth-analysis-of-screen-capture-tech/"><u>In 2024, CaptureCraft In-Depth Analysis of Screen Capture Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-tecno-camon-30-pro-5g-android-sim-unlock-apk-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Android SIM Unlock APK</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-netgear-nighthawk-x10-ad7200-for-superfast-wireless-connectivity/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 for Superfast Wireless Connectivity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/resolved-overcome-phasmophobias-persistent-90-load-in-game/"><u>Resolved: Overcome Phasmophobia's Persistent 90% Load in Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-best-techniques-to-place-your-ps4-camera-effectively/"><u>The Best Techniques to Place Your PS4 Camera Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-essential-guide-to-saving-on-big-screen-viewing-with-lgs-economic-24lh4830-tv-model/"><u>The Essential Guide to Saving on Big Screen Viewing with LG's Economic 24LH4830 TV Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-test-how-reliable-is-motorolas-speedy-mg7700/"><u>The Ultimate Test - How Reliable Is Motorola's Speedy MG7700?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
