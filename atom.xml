Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Google has disrupted the old-guard tech world, from its software and services to the rise of Android in the mobile space—and it has done much the same in the laptop market with its Chromebook concept. Typically priced well below the competition while delivering strong core services and functionality, the Chrome OS-powered notebooks have become the affordable device of choice for many students, schools, and other budget-minded buyers.  </p><p> Launched in early 2017, the Asus Chromebook Flip (C302CA) 12.5-inch laptop has been one of the most popular options, and more than two years later, it’s still on the market. Can this convertible laptop&#x2F;tablet hybrid really supplant ultraportable Windows and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >Mac laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at a fraction of the price, or are the compromises too significant to overcome? We spent a week with the Chromebook Flip to see how it compares to today’s competition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3Q2pRvweVt3Gf6RfBaAwQ15QBag=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_bottom_04-1508a99e93e94312a9477c6ec5c15022.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice"><a href="#Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice"></a><strong>Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice</strong></h2><p> Just as Chromebooks are conceptually designed as budget laptops, the Asus Chromebook Flip is physically built like a budget MacBook. It has the same kind of minimal aesthetic, albeit not to quite the same level of premium visual polish. From the hinge design to the materials and tiny nuances, the Chromebook Flip doesn’t look like a $1,000 laptop.</p><p> That’s not a complaint, just an observation. With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap. It feels like it’s built to deal with the daily stress of usage, but at a weight of just 2.65 pounds, it’s very light and easy to carry around. It does seem to attract dirt and smudges more than a lot of other aluminum laptops we’ve used, although it’s not difficult to rub them away.</p><p> The 12.5-inch touchscreen is a smidge smaller than the common 13-inch laptop screen size, but due to a lot of bezel around the display, the laptop’s overall size is nearly identical to an Apple MacBook Pro (albeit a little thicker). The excessive bezel and large Asus logo do signal the less high-end experience, however.</p><p> With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap.</p><p> Of course, as the name suggests, the Chromebook Flip does something that no MacBook can: it’s convertible, allowing you to fold the screen all the way back into a tablet form, or use a tent-like design to prop the device up and watch videos. The hinge feels sturdy in any position, thankfully, so you don’t have to worry about the tent falling flat, or the screen flopping around in any mode.</p><p> We’ve been using the Chromebook Flip in the tent mode to watch Twitch streams or YouTube playlists while washing dishes or making dinner, or having it run in the corner of a desk while doing other work. It’s super handy to have around as a portable, self-standing streaming display. And in the tablet format, with the screen fully folded back, it’s totally useful. It feels a bit odd to press your fingers against the keys while holding it, but don’t worry: they’re disabled in that form.</p><p> Like current MacBooks, the Chromebook Flip is all about USB-C ports; it puts one on each side and skips full-sized USB-A ports entirely. You can charge the laptop from either of those ports, and that versatility is appreciated. However, there’s also a microSD card port on the right, which is handy as the 64GB internal storage on this model is pretty slim (there are 32GB and 128GB versions available, as well), along with a 3.5mm headphone port on the left side.</p><p> The Chromebook Flip’s keyboard feels great in action. The one-piece chiclet keyboard has a scissor-style key design with 1.4mm of travel, which gives it a more satisfying feel than the latest MacBooks’ keys (which have very little travel), and the keys are responsive and not especially loud in usage. It’s also brightly backlit, which isn’t always the case with Chromebooks. The touchpad below is nicely sized and wider than some we’ve seen, although not nearly as large as Apple’s luxurious trackpads of late.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever"></a><strong>Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever</strong></h2><p> Setting up a Chromebook is incredibly easy. Just power it on (the button is on the left side), connect to a network, accept the terms of service and choose from any options that you’re prompted to, and then plug in your Google account info. If you do already have a Google account, then any bookmarks, Chrome extensions, and apps will automatically be added. If you don’t have a Google account, then you’ll need to sign up for one to use the Chromebook. In any case, this whole process shouldn’t take more than a matter of minutes to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AFQh-ERthm-g0pAMcnQlyA2Rjgw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_bent_02-3dfd0720309d4d12beb5ae695a007aa1.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Display-Small-but-strong"><a href="#Display-Small-but-strong" class="headerlink" title="Display: Small, but strong"></a><strong>Display: Small, but strong</strong></h2><p> As mentioned, the Chromebook Flip’s 12.5-inch, 1080p screen is a little smaller than you’ll see on some rivals, but that doesn’t take away from its usability. It’s colorful and nicely vibrant, and text and graphics typically look crisp. It’s not one of the brightest screens we’ve seen, with a listed brightness of about 300 nits, but that’s pretty common amongst laptops. It’s a little dimmer than we’d like, admittedly. Visibility is impacted in direct sunlight, but in most situations, it’s hard to complain too much about this screen.</p><p> It also acts like an extra-large tablet screen since it’s a touchscreen with 10 points of interaction. It felt just as responsive as any tablet we’ve used.</p><h2 id="Performance-It-does-what-it-can"><a href="#Performance-It-does-what-it-can" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It does what it can"></a><strong>Performance: It does what it can</strong></h2><p> You really can’t pit the Chromebook Flip against pricier Windows and Mac laptops in terms of sheer processing power because Chromebooks aren’t built to be beasts. But they don’t really need to be: the highest quality of graphics processing it’ll need to handle are mobile-quality games, since the Chromebook Flip can run Android apps from the Play Store, and you’re not able to download high-end games from Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p><p> The version of the Chromebook Flip we tested came with a 2.2Ghz Intel Core M3-6Y30 chip, although you can get versions with a Core M7 or Pentium 4405Y chip for more power. Paired with 4GB RAM, we found the device to be plenty speedy getting around Chrome OS.</p><p> Compared to rival laptops like the MacBook Air or Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, you’ll save a huge amount of money while still being able to complete a wide array of tasks.</p><p> Given the access to the Play Store, we benchmarked the Chromebook Flip using the same tests we use for Android phones, with a score of 8,818 on the PCMark 2.0 Work test. The Intel HD Graphics 515 integrated graphics, meanwhile, delivered a frame rate of 12 frames per second in the Car Chase demo and 53 frames per second in the T-Rex demo. Essentially, the Chromebook Flip seems comparable to an upper mid-range Android phone.</p><p> That comparison held up when playing Android racing game Asphalt 9: Legends, which ran at a pretty smooth clip but definitely looked fuzzier than usual thanks to being blown up for the larger screen. Online battle royale shooter PUBG Mobile also ran solidly, although the keyboard and trackpad combination didn’t feel right. We folded the screen back entirely and just used the touchscreen, which worked fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7B1-43v0GHPcS2HESabWT97_XPQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_Keyboard_03-8bc37c7c2d0243bb8ed1fa10e338374f.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886015/19272" target="_top" id="1886015">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886015" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886015/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Audio-Sounds-fine"><a href="#Audio-Sounds-fine" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Sounds fine"></a><strong>Audio: Sounds fine</strong></h2><p> The tiny speaker grates on the left and right side of the Chromebook Flip don’t look too promising, but the playback quality was better than expected. Music output isn’t big and bold, but it’s pretty clear and it can get loud without getting too muddled. Video playback via YouTube and Netflix was sometimes too quiet at full volume, however.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983446">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983446">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983446%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983446/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-No-complaints-here"><a href="#Network-No-complaints-here" class="headerlink" title="Network: No complaints here"></a><strong>Network: No complaints here</strong></h2><p> The Chromebook Flip has dual-band Wi-Fi that can connect to both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks, and we had no issues with either during our testing. We went online at a home network and a Starbucks Google network alike, and things were routinely speedy. On the home network, we saw speeds of about 33Mbps and upload speeds in excess of 10Mbps—essentially the same as we’ve seen with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >other laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136626/26400" target="_top" id="2136626">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136626" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136626/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth"><a href="#Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Nearly a day’s worth"></a><strong>Battery: Nearly a day’s worth</strong></h2><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life. The 39Wh battery cell is rated for up to 10 hours, and while that estimate is ambitious for everyday use, we typically saw seven or more hours of mixed usage with the screen at full brightness. That’s for our usual workflow of surfing the web, typing out documents, watching some YouTube videos, and streaming music from Spotify.</p><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life.</p><p> Our laptop video rundown test, which streams a Netflix movie over Wi-Fi while at 100 percent brightness, delivered a similar result: it lasted 6 hours, 57 minutes before the Chromebook Flip shut down. In both use cases, we were pleasantly surprised by the battery performance of the device—it even beat the 2018 MacBook Air.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VR5Y-1tDILHowNSeA408pnLVtgg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_closed_04-bde5ec8f988c4bb49e4019f95cc47c31.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Software-It’s-definitely-different"><a href="#Software-It’s-definitely-different" class="headerlink" title="Software: It’s definitely different"></a><strong>Software: It’s definitely different</strong></h2><p> ChromeOS delivers an experience that’s halfway between a desktop PC and an Android tablet. It’s a much simpler approach to PC usage, focusing only on essential features and functionality. The interface has a PC-like bar at the bottom, but it’s really more like an app dock on your phone or tablet. Unsurprisingly, the experience is built around Google’s own apps, coming preloaded with the Chrome web browser, Google Docs, YouTube, Google Photos, Google Maps, and more.</p><p> Since the Chromebook Flip’s original release, Google has added the ability to run Android apps downloaded from the Play Store. This is the same Play Store found on scads of smartphones and tablets the world over, offering access to a wide array of games and apps. Not every app looks or acts perfectly on a larger screen, but we mostly had success: business chat app Slack looked like the desktop version on PC and Mac, as did Spotify. Twitch’s interface just looked like it was stretched out from the phone app, but video still played perfectly.</p><p> The Chromebook Flip offers an ideal middle ground between quality and price in the Chromebook department.</p><p> Anyone looking for a familiar PC or Mac experience, or a device that can run familiar PC and Mac apps and games, might struggle with using a Chromebook. It’s really meant for casual usage—things like web browsing, watching media, writing, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-lightweight-laptops-to-buy-4065134" >lightweight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> game playing. Need a device primed for high-end, professional creative software? Need something capable of playing the latest and greatest games? That’s not a Chromebook.</p><p> Luckily, the Chromebook’s reputation as an online-only device isn’t true. For example, Google Docs can be used offline, you can view and edit photos, watch locally-stored media, and play games that don’t require an online connection. It’s really not that different in approach to other PCs, but the overall feel and flow of the experience varies in some key ways.</p><h2 id="Price-It-feels-like-a-steal"><a href="#Price-It-feels-like-a-steal" class="headerlink" title="Price: It feels like a steal"></a><strong>Price: It feels like a steal</strong></h2><p> Here’s where the Asus Chromebook Flip really makes its biggest impact. As mentioned, it’s a capable computer for most everyday tasks, it has a very good screen, and the battery life is stellar. Best of all, it’s priced at $499, although you can find it for a little bit less (we’re seeing it around $400-450 lately). There are cheaper Chromebooks out there that skimp on features and functionality, such as skipping the convertible hinge or touch functionality, or using a lower-end processor. You can spend a lot less and still get a solid laptop.</p><p> But the Chromebook Flip offers an ideal middle ground between quality and price in the Chromebook department—and compared to rival laptops like the MacBook Air or Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, you’ll save a huge amount of money while still being able to complete a wide array of tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NHrMPSrgOWsOuCEYg0M-STQUfsU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Air-v-Surface-Comparison-a255967a27e14762b5c2ad9c442df77f.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135350/19272" target="_top" id="2135350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135350/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Asus-Chromebook-Flip-C302CA-vs-Apple-MacBook-Air"><a href="#Asus-Chromebook-Flip-C302CA-vs-Apple-MacBook-Air" class="headerlink" title="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA vs. Apple MacBook Air"></a><strong>Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA vs. Apple MacBook Air</strong></h2><p> On paper, these laptops shouldn’t be comparable. At $1,099 or more, the MacBook Air is one of the most polished and premium ultraportable laptops you can buy today. The perks are obvious: it has a sleek and refined build, the brighter and higher-resolution 13.3-inch display is gorgeous, and the touchpad is excellent. It also runs macOS, a more robust operating system that still manages to be easy to use.</p><p> However, if your computer needs are pretty basic—browsing the web, watching videos, and typing up documents and filling out spreadsheets—then you don’t need a higher-end computer. And the Chromebook Flip has better battery life than the MacBook Air while delivering comparable functionality in many key ways. No doubt, the MacBook Air is the higher-quality option, but at $600 more, we’re not sure it’s worth it for most users.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-air-2018-review-4779750" >Apple MacBook Air (2018) Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It’s an excellent, affordable laptop.</strong></p><p> Just as the recent crop of cheap, strong mid-range phones has made many flagship smartphones seem excessive and unnecessary, the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA does much the same for laptops. This is a seriously impressive and versatile notebook without any major deficiencies, and it’s priced at just $499—less than half the price of the cheapest Apple laptop right now.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Chromebook Flip C302CA-DHM4</li><li>Product Brand  ASUS</li><li>UPC  889349471715</li><li>Price  $499.99</li><li>Release Date  January 2017</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.97 x 8.28 x 0.54 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  ChromeOS</li><li>Processor  2.2Ghz Intel Core M3-6Y30</li><li>RAM  4GB</li><li>Storage  64GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  39 Wh</li><li>Ports  2x USB-C, microSD, 3.5mm headphone port</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-compensated-analysis-the-vlog-perspective-on-goods/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Compensated Analysis The Vlog Perspective on Goods?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-awesome.techidaily.com/effortless-method-for-transforming-kobo-book-files-into-portable-document-format-pdf/"><u>Effortless Method For Transforming Kobo Book Files Into Portable Document Format (PDF)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/experience-the-featherlight-marvel-in-depth-review-of-the-2018-lg-gram-156-ultrabook/"><u>Experience the Featherlight Marvel: In-Depth Review of the 2018 LG Gram 15.6 Ultrabook!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/expert-review-on-the-twelve-south-compass-pro-intuitively-designed-for-unmatched-stability/"><u>Expert Review on the Twelve South Compass Pro: Intuitively Designed for Unmatched Stability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-when-apple-account-locked-from-apple-iphone-14-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Fix when Apple Account Locked From Apple iPhone 14 Plus?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/marvel-heroes-on-screen-navigating-through-the-midway-points-of-excellence-and-mediocrity/"><u>Marvel Heroes on Screen: Navigating Through the Midway Points of Excellence & Mediocrity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/sequencing-spy-thrills-discover-the-best-viewing-order-for-james-bond-classics/"><u>Sequencing Spy Thrills: Discover the Best Viewing Order for James Bond Classics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/stay-connected-on-the-go-our-selection-of-top-of-the-line-travel-routers-for-202absolutely-here-are-five-seo-friendly-titles-that-convey-similar-meanings-to12/"><u>Stay Connected on the Go: Our Selection of Top-of-the-Line Travel Routers for 202Absolutely!

The Amplifi system is supposed to extend Wi-Fi range, reduce dead zones, and provide better coverage. To see how Ubiquiti’s mesh system holds up to the demands of a household with multiple devices, I connected the Amplifi HD in my test home that contains roughly 50 Wi-Fi connected devices.</p><h2 id="Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points"><a href="#Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points" class="headerlink" title="Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points"></a><strong>Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD Mesh System comes with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >long-range router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and two satellite mesh points. The router has a unique design. It’s small, cube-shaped, and it looks more like an alarm clock or smart display than a router. It doesn’t have antennas protruding from it as you see on most routers.</p><p> The router measures 3.9 inches by 3.9 inches and its matte white with an LCD touchscreen and a light around the bottom perimeter. The router is stylish, yet unassuming. You can set it on a table or entertainment center, and it’ll go unnoticed.</p><p> The two satellite points are very simplistic. They are basic looking, oval-shaped devices with no ports. They plug into a wall outlet, and they have indicator lights to tell you the signal strength. The mesh points, aside from being the same matte-white color, don’t match very well with the main router. Fortunately, they sit in different areas of the home, so the mismatched design doesn’t have too much impact on the overall aesthetic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/s87ZCkRIGWmpbjF2kUOXJRQtOl4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amplifi_LongRangeRouters_HD_02-1a111a806ad7495ba9f36d51121fe5b0.jpg"                      alt="Amplifi HD"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130532/26400" target="_top" id="2130532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130532/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier"><a href="#Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Couldn’t get any easier"></a><strong>Setup: Couldn’t get any easier</strong></h2><p> The setup for the Amplifi HD system is probably the easiest setup process I’ve encountered. The app walks you through the process step-by-step, with pictures to guide you on each instruction. The most difficult part was deciding where to place the two mesh points in my test home. I placed one in the far bedroom and one in my office, two rooms that notoriously experience drop-offs.</p><p> By default, the app creates a dual (2.4 and 5Ghz) network, which directs traffic based on the most efficient pathways. You can create separate 2.4 and 5Ghz networks, or make other adjustments as you see fit though. You can change the band on the mesh points (from 2.4 to 5Ghz), create additional SSIDs, and more. For the purpose of testing, I used the default combined network and allowed the system to direct network traffic between bands.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices"><a href="#Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices"></a><strong>Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD system is not Wi-Fi 6 capable.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-standards-802-11a-802-11b-g-n-and-802-11ac-816553" >It has 802.11ac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s backwards compatible. On the back of the router sit four gigabit LAN ports in addition to the WAN connection. There’s no multigig port, but the four ports were a welcome addition.</p><p> The Amplifi HD seems to be designed for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >optimal signal range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as opposed to device quantity. This is an ideal system for someone with a large area to cover, but it’s not a powerhouse capable of managing an army of devices like the Nighthawk AX12 or the TP-Link Archer AX6000. The Amplifi system thrives in terms of its ability to push a signal over a long distance, as it can cover areas up to 20,000 square feet. The Amplifi system doesn’t exactly thrive in its ability to manage dozens of devices simultaneously.</p><p> In my test home, speeds from my ISP max out at 500 Mbps. In the same room as the main router, Ookla measured the speed at 131 Mbps. The speed remained consistent throughout the home, even in rooms that typically experience drop offs with other routers.

However, with the Nest system, all of the components match, while the Amplifi router looks very different from its mesh points.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The original Xbox One controller has undergone quite a few changes and iterations over the console’s long life. You’ve got the original version that launched with the Xbox One, a slightly updated version of that, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-s-controller-review-4770950" >One S controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and then the Elite. Each of these controllers were pretty well-received in their day, but Microsoft carefully improved and updated them throughout the years to make them even better.</p><p> We reviewed the original $150 Elite controller when it debuted years ago and loved nearly every aspect of it, but it wasn’t flawless suffering from the lack of a few key features and some durability issues. This is where the newly updated Elite Series 2 controller comes in. Listening to feedback provided by gamers on the weaknesses of Series 1, Microsoft has put out what is likely to be the last iteration of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-consoles-4156250" >Xbox One controller, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it’s pretty much perfect—provided you’re willing to pay the hefty price tag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/t8wI_yN2s_uIQ1leo87MmOnXxb4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-5-0c39ec4e89eb45b094471681efec0e7d.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed"><a href="#Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed" class="headerlink" title="Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed"></a><strong>Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed</strong></h2><p> The general format of the Elite Series 2 takes the basic XB1 controller and builds upon that excellent design by adding in tons of extras and features. However, unlike the first Elite controller, this version uses the newer One S model controller as its basis. This means there is no more two-piece design where the top and bottom shells of the controller are separate. The build is less flashy perhaps, no longer sporting a two-tone finish, but it makes it feel much more solid and creates a sleeker look.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout. The original Elite used brushed aluminum as an accent tone, but that’s been swapped for a darker gunmetal finish that I personally love. This accent tone is found along the top bumpers and triggers (that are now textured plastic), as well as the analog sticks and Xbox&#x2F;home button. You’ll also notice that the mini<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the top is now USB Type-C. Aside from my personal dream of this USB port becoming the universal design for all electronics, this implementation offers a superior port with better data transfer speeds and quicker charging times, so it’s nice to see here.</p><p> The grips this time have been heavily revamped (a welcome change as they were a point of weakness for durability on the Series 1), wrapping around the back, sides, and front for a seamless texture. Also changed from the previous Elite, these grips are no longer grey, but instead a nice black tone to match the rest of this black beauty.</p><p> For the face of the Series 2, the four iconic Xbox buttons are unchanged, but there are a few small changes elsewhere. The toggle switch from the Series 1 has now been swapped for a simple push-button that allows you to toggle between premade profiles with even more flexibility. It is easier to accidentally push, but we didn’t find it to be an issue.</p><p> One of the most striking changes to this area is the D-pad, which no longer sticks out from the design with its shiny aluminum surface. This time around, it’s sporting a flat black color that meshes much better with the overall look of the Series 2. It’s still got the radar-dish design that I personally find to be one of the best D-pad designs for any controller ever made.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout.</p><p> The rear of the Series 2 is slightly different from its predecessor, mainly the lack of a removable battery. Now this change is a bit polarizing for two main reasons. A rechargeable battery is super convenient since you can simply plug it in and juice it up, never having to worry about scrambling around for new batteries. On the other hand, this battery, like all rechargeable batteries, will ultimately wear down and eventually need replacing, which you can no longer do on your own. Much like smartphones that have ditched removable batteries, it seems like more and more devices are forgoing that option. We personally love the rechargeable pack included and supposedly it’ll last 10 years, but when it does get worn out, your only option is to send it in to have Microsoft replace it.</p><p> There is also a minimal charging strip where the battery sits, allowing you to use the included dock plugged into your USB-C cord to charge the controller when not in use. This dock is an excellent perk of the Series 2, negating the need for third-party docks that are often plagued with issues. I found it convenient to leave this dock plugged into the Xbox all the time so that I could place the controller there for a quick charge between gaming sessions or at the end of the night.</p><p> Battery aside, the rear of the Series 2 also features the optional paddles and extra buttons if you like to use those for added customization. The only difference with these is the finish, which now matches the dark tone of the D-pad. Lastly, the hair triggers return, but now have three different settings instead of two, providing even more potential customizing.</p><p> The final part of the design we’d like to discuss is the case. The first Elite also included a case, but this too has been refreshed for the Series 2. The first thing of note is that it isn’t quite the same case just rehashed. Close inspection shows that the material has also been changed a bit, making it smoother and less scratchy. The zipper also uses the new gunmetal finish. One of the more important changes to the case is that the top now includes a port for the charging dock, so you can even charge your controller right inside the case.</p><p> Inside the case, the material has also been swapped from grey to black to continue the darker theme of the Series 2. You’ll also notice the foam pad is no longer here, as that’s where the dock sits. This dock can be removed or used inside the case and attaches with a strong magnet. The last two parts of the case are unchanged from Series 1, with a mesh cradle for accessories on the top and a foam organizer to hold all the swappable thumbsticks and paddles when not in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TRrezKVbAUPs2Rud3g4_iOHyxB8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-2-4b3f9d8acd1440089989378253d902f4.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy"><a href="#Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy"></a><strong>Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy</strong></h2><p> The original Elite was perhaps the most comfortable controller I’ve ever used, so with the Series 2, I had high hopes in this department. Thanks to some clever but subtle changes by the Microsoft team, this controller is even better.</p><p> The main points of ergonomic superiority the Elite has over the cheaper XB1 controllers stem from the finish, grips and sheer customization that allows each user to tailor their controller to their preference. With so many options between different combinations of thumbsticks, D-pads, and paddles, everyone can find their optimal setup after some experimenting.</p><p> The grips are perhaps the most important part of this realm since that’s where your hands will be in contact with the controller most of the time. Luckily, they’re even better on the Series 2. While the original Elite only had rubberized grips along the back, the Series 2 has them wrapped around the full circumference of the device. This means your hands rest on them completely, providing a nice grippy surface that never gets slippery.</p><p> The last point of comfort I appreciated on the Series 2 is the textured triggers. While somewhat gimmicky, I found it to be better suited for quickly identifying between the triggers and bumpers, similar to how the home row on your keyboard has bumps on it.</p><p> The only real issue some users may see as a downside of this controller is that it’s quite a hefty device. The controller weighs 348 grams with all attachments, so it might take some getting used to compared to the 210 gram S controller. I personally love the bulk, as it feels premium, but it might not be for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cS5fpyPSlqvyETs-nGxTtAB3vXU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-4-070b6c59b206457ba1068704bbe7bca9.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last"></a><strong>Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last</strong></h2><p> One of our biggest gripes with the original Elite controller was that it lacked Bluetooth functionality despite its premium price tag. Seeing how the much cheaper ONE S variant included this, it was even more frustrating. Thankfully, Microsoft listened to our collective rants and added Bluetooth to the Series 2, which drastically improves the number of devices it can be used with.</p><p> The overall setup process for the new Series 2 is quick and simple (more so than the first Elite). So let’s cover how to use it with both your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and PC. First things first, make sure the rechargeable battery is sufficiently charged (it comes charged out of the box) and you’re ready to pair it with the console.</p><p> To do so, turn on your console first and wait for it to fully boot. Now power on the controller and hold down the pairing button on the top until the Xbox symbol flashes. Then do the same thing on your console’s pairing button until both begin to rapidly flash (this indicates they are searching for each other). Once paired, the flashing will slow and then stop completely to show they have successfully paired.</p><p> As we stated earlier, the inclusion of Bluetooth means using the Series 2 with your PC is even easier than previous<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/games-console-reviews-4102640" >Xbox One controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For those who plan to use their Elite Series 2 with a PC, this is perhaps the single best upgrade over the Series 1, because you no longer need the annoyingly large adapter to pair it with your PC (also saving you an additional $25).</p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC.</p><p> To do this, first ensure your PC is running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and your controller is also updated. Next, you can turn on the controller and head to the computer. At your desktop, select Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices, then turn Bluetooth on so it can discover the controller. After doing so, you should see “Xbox Wireless Controller” pop up, and you can now click “pair” from there and you’re ready to game.</p><p> For those who want to use their PC for local multiplayer games, it should also be noted that you can only connect one Bluetooth controller to your PC at a time. In addition to that limitation, you also can’t use any attachments like headsets, chat pads or the stereo adapter in this mode.</p><p> If you plan to buy this controller to use with other electronics that support Bluetooth devices, make sure you do some research before committing to it, as it doesn’t always work with everything. That said, we did manage to pair the controller with a couple other devices that weren’t officially supported.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v25KBj3XhkgWMjFaqVnLVUUJqSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-3-29dc70adabc64f888db60e817695153f.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability"><a href="#Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability" class="headerlink" title="Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability"></a><strong>Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability</strong></h2><p> To test the performance of the new Elite Series 2 controller, I put this device through several hours of gaming on both PC and Xbox One platforms running a number of games and layouts. The results were promising, so let’s take a closer look.</p><p> Enhanced performance in games is one of the big selling points of the Elite, which is marketed towards players who want to gain an advantage over those with regular controllers. While subtle, I did feel that the Elite improved some small aspects of my gameplay, though skill trumps this in every way.</p><p> For things like shooters, the hair triggers will give you a slight increase to reaction time, as there is less pull, but it takes some getting used to. The longer thumbsticks supposedly help with things like aim time, but getting used to them requires a bit of relearning to get the muscle memory rewired. Personally, I prefer the shorter sticks, but to each their own.</p><p> The paddles are great for adding additional functionality to your controller that non-Elite controllers can’t touch. For racing games like Forza, using these to shift gears means you can do so without having to move your fingers from other buttons. However, because these are unique to the Elite controllers, new users will have a steep learning curve to successfully implement them into their gameplay.</p><p> This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console.</p><p> The enhanced D-pad is perhaps my favorite piece of kit to instantly improve gaming performance. For things like platformers or fighting games, the dish design is exceptionally good at helping you to nail combos or tricky movements, and I always have it equipped.</p><p> No matter what games we used the Series 2 with, from Destiny 2 to Dragon Ball Fighter Z and more, we felt the controller added a subtle but noticeable boost to performance over a regular controller. That being said, it won’t drastically make you better, so don’t get your hopes up.</p><p> In terms of durability, this new Series 2 addresses several weaknesses of the Series 1. The rubber grips used to be a particularly weak point, coming unglued from the body over time. It seems like Microsoft have fixed this, but only time will tell.</p><p> The bumpers on every XB1 controller up until the One S were another point of failure due to the thin plastic piece that attached them to the controller. If you dropped your controller in just the right spot, even from a short height, they often broke and flopped around, requiring you to either send it in for repair or fix it yourself at home. The original Elite also suffered from this, and I experienced this with my first device. Now that the Series 2 is built off the S controller, this is supposedly no longer an issue.</p><p> While we didn’t experience any durability issues with our controller, the long-term durability will need to be assessed at a later date, though it seems to have gotten some upgrades to resolve issues of the past.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136536/16384" target="_top" id="2136536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136536/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console"><a href="#Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console" class="headerlink" title="Price: Like buying a brand new console"></a><strong>Price: Like buying a brand new console</strong></h2><p> Right now, the Elite Series 2 controller retails at an MSRP of $249.99, about $100 more than its predecessor. This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console (or three brand new titles). That can be a tough sell for your average gamer.</p><p> Sure, all of the included extras, customization potential, and the ultra-premium feel is nice, but does that warrant the cost? Well, that’s for you to decide ultimately, but if you do plan on fully utilizing the customization potential, it’s probably worth it. Otherwise, the One S is probably sufficient.</p><p> The argument could be made that considering you get a Bluetooth controller capable of working on XB1 and PC, a charging dock and a nice little case to keep it all together, the cost isn’t awful. But if you want all of those things for less, you can grab an S controller, dock and case for far, far less.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6VfCJGOyjLkAkE_mjiHr7rz8Gyw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-6-0c1d7a2ae4e8443ea5b69f559e52bd12.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134498/18498" target="_top" id="2134498">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134498" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134498/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller"><a href="#Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller"></a><strong>Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller</strong></h2><p> Since the Elite controller really is in a league of its own, the biggest competitor to it is the first generation, which can still be purchased from a number of retailers. We’re going to quickly compare the two to see which might be best for you.</p><p> So we’ve covered a lot of the differences between the two series throughout this article, and while the second iteration is much improved over the first, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-elite-controller-review-4770957" >original Elite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is still a perfectly capable controller with most of the same features. Now that the new one is out, the older model has also dropped a bit in price—making it more appealing. The price of the Series 1 can vary wildly from as little as $100 all the way up to the original tag of $150 depending on where you look, but saving up to $80 for a controller with mostly the same features is an excellent way to get into the Elite series for less.</p><p> Cost aside, there are a few key things you’ll lose if you go with the first model. Perhaps the most noteworthy advantage the Series 2 has is Bluetooth connectivity. This key feature means you no longer need the obtrusive USB wireless adapter to use it with a PC, and it’ll also work with more devices. The other major advantage is the durability improvements on the second iteration, which should make it last even longer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A truly awesome controller with a steep price point.</strong></p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC. However, the steep price point might be a hard pill to swallow for users who don’t like to splurge.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>MPN  400063527030</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Weight  2.89 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.6 x 3.6 x 7.6 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Type  Elite</li><li>Wired&#x2F;Wireless  Wireless</li><li>Removable Cable  Yes</li><li>Battery life  ~40 hours</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;outputs  USB Type-C, 3.5mm jack, Xbox data port</li><li>Warranty  90-day warranty</li><li>Compatibility  All Xbox One Consoles, Windows 10 PCs, Bluetooth devices</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-instagram-meets-tiktok-syncing-social-media/"><u>[New] In 2024, Instagram Meets TikTok Syncing Social Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leading-audio-transformation-software-listings/"><u>2024 Approved Leading Audio Transformation Software Listings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/cost-effective-reading-analyzing-the-newly-released-amazon-kindle-2019/"><u>Cost-Effective Reading: Analyzing the Newly Released Amazon Kindle (2019)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/efficiently-link-to-shared-resources-a-mac-users-guide-to-mapping-drives/"><u>Efficiently Link to Shared Resources: A Mac User's Guide to Mapping Drives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/evaluating-both-which-is-better-nintendo-switch-lite-or-the-new-oled/"><u>Evaluating Both: Which Is Better, Nintendo Switch Lite or the New OLED?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-tips.techidaily.com/fehlerbehebung-bei-der-windows-10-versionshistorie-funktion/"><u>Fehlerbehebung Bei Der Windows 10 Versionshistorie-Funktion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-corrupt-mp4-and-mov-files-of-sony-using-video-repair-utility-on-mac-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>How to Repair corrupt MP4 and MOV files of Sony using Video Repair Utility on Mac?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-ritual-of-independent-instagram-sound-creation/"><u>In 2024, Mastering the Ritual of Independent Instagram Sound Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/navigating-the-world-of-dying-light-an-exploration-of-cooperative-parkour-in-a-post-apocalyptic-setting/"><u>Navigating the World of Dying Light: An Exploration of Cooperative Parkour in a Post-Apocalyptic Setting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/review-of-nokia-72-exceeding-expectations-in-the-mid-tier-market/"><u>Review of Nokia 7.2 - Exceeding Expectations in the Mid-Tier Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-unanticipated-security-alerts-in-win10win11/"><u>Troubleshooting Unanticipated Security Alerts in Win10/Win11</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.</p><p> Generous cutouts allow for easy access to all ports, and vents on the bottom of the case help to maintain airflow and keep your computer from overheating. Fintie offers a number of color and style options, from the Vintage Leather look that we tested to playful graphic prints and sleek solid colors.</p><p> It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.</p><p> The synthetic leather provides a comfortable grip, and that meant a great deal to us when we were assessing the overall utility of the case. It’s comfortable to walk around with it in your hands, and there’s enough traction in the synthetic leather to keep it from slipping in most cases. The Fintie also offers a host of other color and style options to allow for a little customization.</p><p> One more plus? Contrary to some other options, this case is easy to put on and take off, fitting much like a second skin. It is loose enough to remove without a hassle and tight enough to effectively protect your computer. And the case doesn’t interfere with your use of the laptop at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oLEmxLNytxQINRktM9nWjKfhTZ0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4153328-4-ec18ce2eec6b4e73853f562114489d01.jpg"                      alt="Fintie Protective Case for MacBook Pro 13"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Hayley Prokos</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027162/19272" target="_top" id="2027162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027162/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-instructions-needed"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-instructions-needed" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No instructions needed"></a><strong>Setup Process: No instructions needed</strong></h2><p> Once you’ve unwrapped this product, there’s no need to read any instructions—the case requires little setup.

It includes the newest version of Samsung’s S Pen, and you can add on a keyboard case to transform the Tab S6 into a hybrid. I tested the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 for about a month, evaluating it to see how it compares to other modern tablets.</p><p> The Galaxy Tab S6 is remarkably slim, measuring only 0.22 inches in thickness, and weighs less than a pound, so it’s not too heavy to take with you on the go either. The interior bezel, which is roughly a quarter of an inch, uniformly bounds the perimeter of the screen, which is constructed of Corning<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/gorilla-glass-4160832" >Gorilla Glass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 3.</p><p> The back of the tablet is aluminum, which is ideal for durability and day-to-day use. You can choose between three colors: mountain grey, rose blush, or cloud blue. I tested the mountain grey version. There’s an indenture on the back where you place the included S Pen. It connects to the tablet magnetically, and the tablet also charges the S Pen, which contains an internal battery. In spite of the magnets, the S Pen does come loose from the tablet relatively easily, so I found myself holding it against the tablet when I carried it with me. If you purchase the keyboard case, it includes a cover for the S Pen for a better, more secure placement.</p><p> The Galaxy Tab S6 has a USB-C connector, but no 3.5 mm headphone jack. There’s a microSD card slot on the side to expand your storage to 512 MB, although this is becoming increasingly unnecessary as cloud storage applications become more commonplace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VjADXw7yUZHkkKXdcHBM8o70Ywc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_S6_02-4011b3ea196f44e2a7a111bae1212dc2.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Display-10-5-inch-Super-AMOLED"><a href="#Display-10-5-inch-Super-AMOLED" class="headerlink" title="Display: 10.5-inch Super AMOLED"></a><strong>Display: 10.5-inch Super AMOLED</strong></h2><p> You can usually rely on Samsung devices to have top-notch display quality, and the Tab S6 is no different. The super AMOLED display is crisp and clear. The text is sharp, and the colors are bright and vivid. The 10.5-inch display feels large enough to watch shows and movies or to use as a hybrid when you connect the keyboard case.</p><p> The screen displays 2560x1600 resolution, with a pixel density of 287 pixels per inch. This is pretty close to on par with the 11-inch iPad Pro, which displays 2388x1668 resolution at 264 pixels per inch, and with the Surface Pro 7, which boasts 2736x1824 resolution at 267 pixels per inch.</p><p> Some users report an issue with the screen, where it randomly goes blank in the middle of using the Tab S6. Audio will still play, but the tablet’s screen will go dark, and the user will have to re-awaken the Tab S6 to continue their tasks. I personally experienced this issue while testing a refurbished version of the Tab S6.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-pHfCamdNdeJAmfn1IG93dda0i4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_S6_03-ecf977b8c98b41a08872f0605a589246.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135351/19272" target="_top" id="2135351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Performance-Qualcomm-855"><a href="#Performance-Qualcomm-855" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Qualcomm 855"></a><strong>Performance: Qualcomm 855</strong></h2><p> The Tab S6 has the Qualcomm 855 processor, which is a pretty solid mobile CPU. It comes in two versions: one version with 128GB of storage and 6 GB of RAM, and one version with 256 GB of storage and 8 GB of RAM. I tested the former version. On PCMark Work 2.0, the lower level Tab S6 scored a 9022. On Geekbench 5, the Tab S6 scored a single core score of 747 and a multi-core score of 2,518. It’s multi-core scores come in very close to the A12 Bionic chip in the iPad (2019).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TIUmjQSMgpAJw4W3I6fcgiYY1BM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_S6_06-cc64b6b41e8f4420b9fe38d223541b52.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Productivity-S-Pen-included-keyboard-case-sold-separately"><a href="#Productivity-S-Pen-included-keyboard-case-sold-separately" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: S Pen included, keyboard case sold separately"></a><strong>Productivity: S Pen included, keyboard case sold separately</strong></h2><p> The newest version of the S Pen is Bluetooth enabled, so you can control the Tab S6 tablet remotely. You can snap a group pic from a distance or control a slideshow presentation by swiping to the next slide without touching your tablet. You can use gestures within compatible apps, although few apps have S Pen compatibility.</p><p> The S Pen does allow for more efficient use of the tablet, especially once you get used to it. After about a week, the S Pen became like an extra appendage for me. In addition to quicker screen navigation, the S Pen is excellent for drawing, photo editing, video editing, quick note-taking, messaging on social media, translating, and virtually signing documents.</p><p> The Tab S6 also features Samsung DeX mode, which provides more of a desktop feel, and allows you to cast your display on a larger screen.</p><p> After about a week, the S Pen became like an extra appendage for me.</p><h2 id="Audio-Dolby-Atmos"><a href="#Audio-Dolby-Atmos" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Dolby Atmos"></a><strong>Audio: Dolby Atmos</strong></h2><p> The Galaxy Tab S6 has four speakers—two on the bottom and two on the top. The speakers are AKG tuned, and they even support Dolby Atmos. You can enable Dolby Atmos in the tablet’s sound settings. Overall, the speakers sound exceptional for a mobile device. I was impressed by the immersive sound quality when watching movies and shows. For music, the bass isn’t as punchy as it could be, but it sounds better than most tablets I’ve encountered.</p><p> I do wish the Galaxy Tab S6 had a headphone jack. I was able to purchase a USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter on Amazon for about $10, but it would have been nice to have a 3.5 mm jack available.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036496/19272" target="_top" id="2036496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036496/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-No-Wi-Fi-6"><a href="#Network-No-Wi-Fi-6" class="headerlink" title="Network: No Wi-Fi 6"></a><strong>Network: No Wi-Fi 6</strong></h2><p> The Tab S6 supports Bluetooth version 5.0 and 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac Wi-Fi networks, and you can connect it on the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. I live in a suburb outside of Raleigh, NC, and my network speeds max out at 400 Mbps. I have a Wi-Fi 6 capable router, but the Galaxy Tab S6 doesn’t support Wi-Fi 6.</p><p> The internet connection is stable, and the Tab S6 appears to have a reliable Wi-Fi adapter. When I connected to the 5 GHz band in my home, I was able to clock 329 Mbps (download) and 39 Mbps (upload).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uFYTAOkfm7I2LO-YvrgzbeB-65I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_S6_04-c700338e384c41a1890551005ff31019.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Camera-Dual-rear-cameras"><a href="#Camera-Dual-rear-cameras" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Dual rear cameras"></a><strong>Camera: Dual rear cameras</strong></h2><p> The Tab S6 has dual rear cameras, and a single front-facing camera. It has a 13 MP camera and a 5 MP camera on the back, and an 8 MP camera on the front. For a tablet, the camera quality is actually pretty good. It’s not as good as your typical flagship phone, but it’s better than you’d expect on a hybrid tablet. Photos are surprisingly clean and detailed, so you could absolutely get a good group pic at the office, or snap a clear pic of a document you need to send.</p><p> The Tab S6 can take UHD video (3840x2160) at 30 FPS with the rear camera and FHD (1920x1080) at 30 FPS with the front cam, and it has a few cool software features like a food mode, pro mode, night mode, and hyperlapse. You can also create an AR emoji and take advantage of additional features like Bixby Vision.</p><h2 id="Battery-Worse-than-the-Tab-S4"><a href="#Battery-Worse-than-the-Tab-S4" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Worse than the Tab S4"></a><strong>Battery: Worse than the Tab S4</strong></h2><p> The Tab S6 has a serviceable battery capacity. The 7040 mAh battery lasts for up to 15 hours play time. The S Pen does take some of the Tab’s battery, but it doesn’t affect the battery life to a noticeable degree. I was able to use the S6 on and off for most of the day, and I still had some battery leftover for the next day. The Galaxy Tab S4 had a slightly better 7300 mAh battery that lasted for up to 16 hours of play time. I was surprised to see that the Tab S6 had less battery capacity than its predecessor.</p><p> I was able to use the S6 on and off for most of the day, and I still had some battery leftover for the next day.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014851/22899" target="_top" id="2014851">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014851" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014851/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Now-on-Android-10"><a href="#Software-Now-on-Android-10" class="headerlink" title="Software: Now on Android 10"></a><strong>Software: Now on Android 10</strong></h2><p> Initially, the Tab S6 released with Android 9.

The tablet also comes equipped with Samsung Daily, which is a rebranding of Bixby Home, and a number of other Samsung applications like Samsung’s virtual assistant Bixby, SmartThings, Samsung Flow, and Samsung Kids.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C7-02cY18jujcl8-9vfJim9_H_M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_S6_05-2f0768554c044e18bedec871758e51ef.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135414/19272" target="_top" id="2135414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135414/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528700/16446" target="_top" id="1528700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528700/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-On-the-high-end"><a href="#Price-On-the-high-end" class="headerlink" title="Price: On the high end"></a><strong>Price: On the high end</strong></h2><p> The Galaxy Tab S6 sells for $649 for the 128 gig version, which is pricey for an android tablet.

However, after a few weeks with this awesome little device, I’m now a firm believer in its merits as both a means towards achieving a healthier lifestyle and as a minimalist smartwatch. It has succeeded in putting me on the path towards meaningful weight loss where countless diets and New Years’ resolutions have failed.</p><h2 id="Design-Minimalist-masterpiece"><a href="#Design-Minimalist-masterpiece" class="headerlink" title="Design: Minimalist masterpiece"></a><strong>Design: Minimalist masterpiece</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Charge 4 is sleek and stylish with a futuristic flare. The patterned strap is attractive and catches the light in interesting ways. The square screen is practical, but may not appeal to folks who prefer round watches. It feels pretty durable, and it’s waterproof down to 50 meters. After a number of rigorous outdoor adventures, it’s come through unscathed. The Charge 4 comes with a charging station and both small and large wristbands. It’s easy to swap the wrist bands out, and Fitbit sells a variety of alternative styles.</p><p> It has succeeded in putting me on the path towards meaningful weight loss where countless diets and New Years’ resolutions have failed.</p><p> A quick press of the button on the side of the watch takes you back to the clock face or turns it on if it fails to show up automatically when you move your wrist (which does happen, albeit infrequently). Hold the button down and you get access to do not disturb, sleep mode, and other functions, as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-fitbit-pay-4582307" >Fitbit Pay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hXje3GJQ1qjDfhBph7Q2s-LKCTE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Charge-4-Fitness-Tracker-4-5fb3fda3d53d4120bfb7c3e1b418abab.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Charge 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130887/7443" target="_top" id="2130887">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130887" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130887/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-process-Streamlined-and-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-process-Streamlined-and-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Streamlined and straightforward"></a><strong>Setup process: Streamlined and straightforward</strong></h2><p> My<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review-4683995" >Samsung Galaxy Note 9 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> immediately noticed that the Charge 4 was nearby when I powered the smartwatch up, and a tap of the screen of my phone took me to the download page for the app. Once installed, the app guided me through the setup process. You’ve got to enter a bunch of information about yourself, including name, birth date, weight, and gender. Next, the app shows a helpful animation of how to attach the charger. I like the smiley face the device gives you when it starts charging; it’s a small touch, but it gives the Charge 4 a little jolt of personality.</p><p> After this, it was time to actually pair the Charge 4 to my phone, and after an annoying Squaretrade “Fitbit protection plan” ad, I needed to install an update. While that was downloading I was given a list of first-time user guides. This was useful, with plenty of information about how to use the device, though I would have preferred a printed manual. After the device is up to date, a further set of animated guides showed me the various controls and gestures used to navigate the Charge 4. Finally, the app had a few product care tips and another annoying ad (this time for a Fitbit Premium account) and was ready to go.</p><h2 id="Comfort-A-good-fit"><a href="#Comfort-A-good-fit" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: A good fit"></a><strong>Comfort: A good fit</strong></h2><p> As someone with ridiculously large wrists, I really appreciated that the Charge 4 comes with a larger watch band. It was easy to switch out the band by depressing a recessed button on the underside of the watch, and between the two included bands, the Charge 4 should fit just about anyone. I was surprised by just how comfortable this smartwatch was for me; the larger band has plenty of room to spare even on my wrists.</p><p> As someone with ridiculously large wrists, I really appreciated that the Charge 4 comes with a larger watch band.</p><h2 id="Performance-A-digital-fitness-coach"><a href="#Performance-A-digital-fitness-coach" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A digital fitness coach"></a><strong>Performance: A digital fitness coach</strong></h2><p> No fitness tracker is 100% accurate, and the Charge 4 is no exception, but that’s not as much of a problem as you might assume. Though everything from step counts to elevation change to calories expended and consumed has margins for error, they nonetheless give you goals to work towards, and this rough data is perfectly adequate to help you become more conscious of your physical health.</p><p> Despite small variances in reporting vs. the actual number of steps I was taking or calories I was consuming, this device made me more aware of how much exercise I was getting and how much I was eating. This encouraged me to get more exercise and eat healthier. Also, it’s worth noting that the Charge 4 tracks so many different stats that the cumulative data from such a large variety of factors helps to iron out irregularities from any given reading.</p><p> Sleep tracking is a cool feature, and it seemed to have a pretty good idea of when I was asleep and when I was awake, though sometimes it would fail to record detailed statistics for no discernable reason. Heart Rate tracking isn’t bad either, though my impression is that it was estimating my heart rate somewhat high.</p><p> Calorie tracking was most useful to me, as it gave me a rough estimate to compare to my caloric intake. By entering every meal I ate into the app, I got an idea of how much I could eat during the day and how much exercise I needed to get. Because of this I have been going for more walks and eating healthier. I have almost entirely cut snacks out of my day, and I find myself doing circles around the driveway or going up and down flights of stairs in order to be able to have a little dessert after dinner.</p><p> I didn’t find personalized exercise reminders, the workout intensity map, or exercise tracking to be particularly helpful, but that’s very much a matter of personal preference. In terms of navigation and functionality, the Charge 4 functions very well without much in the way of lag, and the interface is easy to navigate. The only problem comes when you get below 20% battery. A power-saving mode kicks in at that point and the functionality of the watch drops significantly. You’ll want to charge it before it gets to this point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UlCfm0YzhPSZMR3WWRs3oeCWPsA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Charge-4-Fitness-Tracker-2-6afa07ba83e74effb1bd3521b2b43391-3287de2174dc42359f46f06e6576d80b.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Charge 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975802/19272" target="_top" id="1975802">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975802" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975802/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-but-ad-infested"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-but-ad-infested" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive but ad infested"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive but ad infested</strong></h2><p> Both the interface of the watch and the companion app for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ios-1994355" >IOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> function nearly flawlessly. Menus are easy to navigate, and data is both in-depth while also being easy to access and analyze. Though the hardware itself is a marvel of design and miniaturization, the software is where the magic happens. The Charge 4 essentially turns weight loss and healthy living into a game, and for me, this is an addictive and rewarding game indeed.</p><p> One thing to consider is that some features such as sleep score details and custom challenges are locked behind a steep paywall that will run you $10 a month or $80 per year. It’s pretty easy to set up a subscription like this, never use it, and forget to cancel it until years later when you’ve spent a hefty chunk of change on the service. Annoyingly, the ad for this premium service is permanently affixed to the toolbar in the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wFO4EEqsgPPy2Dq-eUgUTZ1q70A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Charge-4-Fitness-Tracker-3-38e2a0e1ea5a46ee85939b8dec6d6a48.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Charge 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982457">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982457.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982457">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982457.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982457%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982457/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997630/19272" target="_top" id="1997630">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997630" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997630/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Life-Awesome-but-with-caveats"><a href="#Battery-Life-Awesome-but-with-caveats" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Awesome, but with caveats"></a><strong>Battery Life: Awesome, but with caveats</strong></h2><p> The Charge 4 lasts about six days on a charge under typical use, which is better than most advanced smartwatches. It charges quickly and most of the time isn’t something you have to worry about.</p><p> However, I did run into a few issues worth mentioning. First of all, when the battery drops below 20% the Charge 4 seems to go into a power-saving mode that limits functionality. Secondly, using features like exercise tracking that use the GPS will drain the battery much more quickly. When I embarked with a full charge on a two-day backpacking trip and set the Charge 4 to record the hike as an exercise it only lasted me through roughly 75% of the two days of trekking.</p><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a><strong>Price: Good value</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $150 the Fitbit Charge 4 is somewhat expensive but fairly priced for a basic smartwatch. However, extra accessories and subscription services can quickly add to the cost.</p><h2 id="Fitbit-Charge-4-vs-Fossil-Sport"><a href="#Fitbit-Charge-4-vs-Fossil-Sport" class="headerlink" title="Fitbit Charge 4 vs. Fossil Sport"></a><strong>Fitbit Charge 4 vs. Fossil Sport</strong></h2><p> For a more fully-featured smartwatch with a more classic watch design, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fossil-sport-review-5069585" >Fossil Sport <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an attractive alternative to the Fitbit Charge 4. Using Google’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/complete-guide-to-android-wear-4086408" >Wear OS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and utilizing a full color LED displace, the Fossil Sport is a far more versatile device. However, the Charge 4 has the benefit of simplicity that lends a much more intuitive experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Whether you’re looking for a minimalist smartwatch or an effective fitness tracker, the Fitbit Charge 4 is a generally excellent device.</strong></p><p> I was frankly shocked by how much I have come to like the Fitbit Charge 4. It’s as functional as it’s good looking, and provides both reasonably accurate fitness tracking and well integrated basic smartwatch functionality. Despite a few minor flaws such as a subscription paywall for some features and battery hogging GPS I can heartily recommend the Charge 4.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094418/7443" target="_top" id="2094418">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094418" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094418/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Charge 4 Fitness Tracker</li><li>Product Brand  Fitbit</li><li>Price  $150.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.4 x 0.9 x 0.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  90 days</li><li>Battery  Up to 6 Days</li><li>Waterproof  Yes</li><li>Heart rate tracking  YES</li><li>GPS  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-first-steps-in-virtual-conferencing-with-zoom/"><u>[New] In 2024, First Steps in Virtual Conferencing with Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-deciphering-old-facebook-threads-a-step-by-step-mobile-and-desktop-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Deciphering Old Facebook Threads A Step-by-Step Mobile & Desktop Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-10-leading-church-live-streaming-sites/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Discover 10 Leading Church Live Streaming Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-hp-and-chromebook-guide-to-live-video-capture/"><u>2024 Approved HP & Chromebook Guide to Live Video Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-rhythm-reviews-cutting-edge-sound/"><u>2024 Approved Rhythm Reviews Cutting-Edge Sound</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/assessing-the-great-outdoors-rc-experience-the-blh4100-blade-120-s-ready-to-fly-helicopter/"><u>Assessing the Great Outdoors RC Experience: The BLH4100 Blade 120 S Ready To Fly Helicopter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/bump-up-efficiency-upgrade-your-computer-for-windows-11/"><u>Bump Up Efficiency: Upgrade Your Computer for Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/clash-of-the-titans-bard-vs-bing-chatbot-face-off/"><u>Clash of the Titans: Bard Vs.

I tested the Echo Dot (4th Gen) to find out.</p><h2 id="Design-A-completely-new-look"><a href="#Design-A-completely-new-look" class="headerlink" title="Design: A completely new look"></a><strong>Design: A completely new look</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TtbQpfhvpeKgt-Aso1WoKQ6m2VI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-2-89fbd54fb6a14efba195a0094b8d7b6f.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> As time has passed and Amazon has released newer versions of its Echo Dot speaker, the company has shied away from sharp edges and hard plastic shells in favor of softer designs. You may remember the 2nd-gen model had more of a puck-shape, with a hard plastic shell and more defined edges. The earlier Dots looked more like networking equipment than home devices. However, this changed with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-4772274#:~:text=The%20Amazon%20Echo%20Dot%20%283rd,Dot%20is%20a%20great%20buy." >3rd-Gen Dot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which had an airier feel, slightly rounded edges, and a fabric surround. This made the Dot feel more like a speaker made for the home and less like an office product.</p><p> The new Dot (4th Gen) is even softer and rounder, with a spherical shape and fabric covering most of the speaker, including the top portion. The 4th Gen Dot comes in three color options: charcoal, glacier white, and twilight blue. I tested the twilight blue color.</p><p> The new Dot measures 3.94 inches in diameter and 3.54 inches tall. The light ring sits on the bottom and the four main button controls sit on top of the speaker. The raised buttons make the Echo Dot look kind of like a small bowling ball from certain angles, but it’s nice to have the microphone off button right on top of the device for easy access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HELf_jWdoxnVe1w7XOL9sC7GoO8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-4-f100069b4b7d40dc8661b1614e150934.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043603/7443" target="_top" id="2043603">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043603" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043603/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> The 4th Gen Dot still has a 3.5 mm output jack, which I was really pleased to see. Google’s Nest Mini (2nd Gen) lacks a 3.5 mm jack. However, unlike Google’s newest mini smart speaker, the Echo Dot does not have a keyhole mount for mounting on a wall. The speaker is meant for placement on a flat surface, as evidenced by the rubberized bottom that prevents slipping and helps the Echo Dot stay in place.</p><p> Overall, I really appreciate the design of the new Dot. Modern and elegant, it fits into my living room, kitchen, or bedroom, as it doesn’t have a cold feel that takes away from the space. The 4th-Gen Dot is made from environmentally conscious materials like post-consumer recycled plastics and fabrics, thus securing it a “Climate Pledge Friendly” tag on Amazon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484944/16446" target="_top" id="1484944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484944/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-as-ever"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-as-ever" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy as ever"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy as ever</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-amazon-echo-4153561" >Setting up the Echo Dot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is simple, especially if you already have the Alexa app downloaded.

When testing speakers, I frequently use the song_Titanium_ by David Guetta featuring Sia because it has a range of low, mid, and high tones. For testing bass, I often use the song_Chains_ by Nick Jonas. The Echo Dot (4th Gen) sounds pretty clear on all volume levels. There is a very slight hiss on the highest volume, but it’s barely noticeable, and it doesn’t take too much away from the listening experience.</p><p> With a 1.6-inch front-firing speaker, the Echo Dot (4th Gen) is loud enough to play music throughout a large space. I can hear the music throughout the entire first floor of my home. The Dot doesn’t sound as rich as the regular Echo, but it still sounds good, especially considering its small size (and small price tag). If you want to, you can also connect an external speaker using the 3.5 mm jack or using a Bluetooth connection.</p><p> With a 1.6-inch front-firing speaker, the Echo Dot (4th Gen) is loud enough to play music throughout a large space.</p><p> Voice recognition is so important in smart speakers because they need to be able to hear your voice commands even when there’s background noise. The Echo Dot (4th Gen) has four far-field microphones for voice detection like its predecessor. It does a good job of detecting commands from across the room, even in the presence of household noises like a running dishwasher or light conversation. However, if you have a room full of people loudly talking, you might need to raise your voice slightly to get the mics to hear your commands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UFZM9HpoakK6sRg-7Vm2W8uLIQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-6-with-Clock-86c91da96d4043369f0a4e97b22c4209.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Features-The-same-Alexa"><a href="#Features-The-same-Alexa" class="headerlink" title="Features: The same Alexa"></a><strong>Features: The same Alexa</strong></h2><p> The Echo Dot (4th Gen) is powered by<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The Alexa voice assistant on the new Echo Dot is the same Alexa that you get on the Echo Dot (3rd Gen).

I tested the “with clock” iteration as a part of this review, but I did not test the kids model.</p><p> I was blown away by the Echo Dot (4th Gen) With Clock. It’s the same device (internally) as the regular Echo Dot (4th Gen), but it has an LED display on the front of the speaker. Doesn’t sound like much, right?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bnVMEDjyf8t4zDkpRwr4-5msD2s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-7-with-Clock-9b93a56f3d0049c5a2064cd4b21c7cb5.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139113/17108" target="_top" id="2139113">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139113" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139113/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> It actually makes a huge difference in the looks of the Dot speaker. The addition of the clock improves the aesthetics big time, making the Dot look less like a speaker and more like a really cool smart clock. Because the Dot is round, it ends up having a large space on the front—almost like a face; it’s a perfect home for the clock display.</p><p> The “with clock” version displays the time, and you can turn the display on or off, as well as adjust the brightness. The clock can also display the temperature or work as a stopwatch. In the previous generation, the clock felt like an afterthought. The clock on the new 4th Gen model feels so intentional—it truly improves the design and makes the “with clock” version a much more desirable model in the Echo lineup.</p><p> I like the Echo Dot (4th Gen) with Clock better than the regular Echo Dot (4th Gen), as the regular version feels like it’s missing something.</p><h2 id="Price-60-with-clock-50-without"><a href="#Price-60-with-clock-50-without" class="headerlink" title="Price: $60 with clock, $50 without"></a><strong>Price: $60 with clock, $50 without</strong></h2><p> The Echo Dot (4th Gen) retails for $50, and for $10 more, you can pick up the “with clock” version. The clock is very much worth it simply because the device looks so much better with it (aside from the obvious added functionality), and for first-time buyers, the default model is definitely worth $50. It looks great, sounds good, and provides an affordable way to access Alexa and control your smart home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fdW9QpFUSBjNMTYTGdjFggaOH9Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-5-Comparison-6841e2f32a734282b509976489bd0383.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-vs-Apple-HomePod-Mini"><a href="#Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-vs-Apple-HomePod-Mini" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen) vs. Apple HomePod Mini"></a><strong>Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen) vs. Apple HomePod Mini</strong></h2><p> Apple announced the release of its<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-homepod-4146975" >HomePod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Mini speaker, and it’s available for sale in November. The Siri-powered HomePod Mini is 3.3 inches tall, and it has a somewhat similar spherical shape to the Echo Dot. The HomePod Mini has a three-mic array, compared to the Dot’s four-mic array. However, the HomePod Mini has Apple’s S5 chip, and it’s in a higher price category at $99.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Primarily a design upgrade.</strong></p><p> The new Echo Dot is a great speaker at a great price, but it’s not worth an upgrade if you already have the 3rd-gen Dot unless you’re going with the clock version.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Days Gone is another action-adventure survival game in the zombie genre. It does a lot of things that other similar titles do―crafting, stealth, and gathering resources―but with an added emphasis on your character’s vehicle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ryi3-WPMYdCrQ8y_6kRDMiMzxZ0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Days-Gone-Zombie-Game-PS4-6-0cbb39a028324cf9a576db1941bce0a4.jpg"                      alt="Days Gone"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-A-long-installation-process"><a href="#Setup-Process-A-long-installation-process" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: A long installation process"></a><strong>Setup Process: A long installation process</strong></h2><p> If you purchased the game on disc, when you first pop it into your PlayStation 4 you’ll have to update. The update is fairly large, so be prepared to wait. The game finally launches, you’ll be prompted to select between easy, normal, or hard difficulty, and then treated to a scene-setting introductory cutscene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HE8j4XoxbKMWIQagUtGCXFf6bKo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Days-Gone-Zombie-Game-PS4-2-3b29272bf1b2423781e104041dc00457.jpg"                      alt="Days Gone"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111994/7443" target="_top" id="2111994">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111994" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111994/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-A-man-who-lost-his-wife"><a href="#Plot-A-man-who-lost-his-wife" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A man who lost his wife"></a><strong>Plot: A man who lost his wife</strong></h2><p> The first cutscene you’re shown involves three characters: the protagonist Deacon, his loyal friend Boozer, and Sarah, Deacon’s wife. Sarah has been stabbed, and with chaos breaking out as a deadly virus spreads through the city, the trio is desperate to find help. When a helicopter lands nearby, they load Sarah onboard, but there’s only room for two passengers. When Boozer refuses to board, Deacon stays behind to make sure he gets out of the city alive. You don’t actually see any zombies in this beginning sequence, or even much of the world. It’s about establishing the relationships between these people and the desperate circumstances unfolding around them.</p><p> After a time jump forward to two years later, you’ll see how Deacon and Boozer operate in this new world. They’re riding down a road on their bikes, chasing someone. From the dialogue, you get the impression the man hurt a friend, and there’s a bounty on his head. Once you catch up, you’ll get what you need from him and leave―only to find your bike too damaged to drive. You and Boozer will set out to find the bike parts you need to repair it at a nearby garage.</p><p>As in most zombie fiction, the real monster is man.</p><p> It’s only on your journey to this garage, at least a half-hour into the game, that you come across the first zombie. In this world, they’re called Freakers, and the children version of them are called Newts, but they’re not the most dangerous adversaries in this broken post-apocalypse. As in most zombie fiction, the real monster is man.</p><p> You’ll have issues with a cult group called Rippers, and bandits who survive by preying on anyone who’s not well armed or capable enough to defend what’s theirs. Unfortunately, Boozer gets badly hurt in one of these encounters, and while you’re trying to find him the help he needs, you get a lead that perhaps Sarah, who you assumed was dead, is still alive. The rest of the game involves exploring this open-world, helping the people you meet, and trying to find Sarah, all while keeping your friend Boozer alive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XWR-CgFF865KBE1ipv7cwdi-P3w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Days-Gone-Zombie-Game-PS4-5-b1914ac9859b409d9460fea24fc7f251.jpg"                      alt="Days Gone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144297/7443" target="_top" id="2144297">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144297" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144297/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902319/19272" target="_top" id="1902319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902319/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Standard-zombie-action-with-bikers"><a href="#Gameplay-Standard-zombie-action-with-bikers" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Standard zombie action with bikers"></a><strong>Gameplay: Standard zombie action with bikers</strong></h2><p> Days Gone is a third-person, action-adventure, zombie survival game with single-player gameplay. It operates in an open-world where you drive around your bike and explore different camps to collect supplies and complete missions. You’ll find a range of enemies from wild animals, zombies, and even other survivors.</p><p> Probably the best thing Days Gone has going for it is the biker angle. You can upgrade and customize your bike, and drifting around corners is fun; the handling in general is really solid, and after a few upgrades you can really chew up large distances quickly.</p><p> The wide variety of guns that largely keep the combat from getting stale.</p><p> There’s also a wide variety of guns that largely keep the combat from getting stale. This is nice, as a lot of survival games lean on one or two primary weapons and seriously restrict the ammo you find. Days Gone, by contrast, feeds you decent weapons fairly early on (as well as a fairly steady supply of ammo), and you can further modify them to suit your needs. If you do burn through all your ammo, the melee weapons are solid backups.</p><p> Unfortunately, Days Gone overcomplicates a huge number of its systems and interactions. It feels like there’s a button you have to press, hold, or mash for every interaction. Then there’s the crafting system, which is overly complicated and unintuitive. A little streamlining on the design side would’ve dramatically improved the quality of the entire game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9B_OIRiqlP1YbsMLjs-zzDc3WAs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Days-Gone-Zombie-Game-PS4-3-cc2a2d9c613d4330b5d4d38408d6eae3.jpg"                      alt="Days Gone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037358/7443" target="_top" id="2037358">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037358" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037358/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Graphics-Smooth-and-detailed"><a href="#Graphics-Smooth-and-detailed" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Smooth and detailed"></a><strong>Graphics: Smooth and detailed</strong></h2><p> The graphics, on the other hand, are remarkable. The details of the characters feel real, especially with Deacon. His tattoos, attire, even the rings on his fingers are well rendered. The scenery also looks great—cracks in the roads are filled with grass and wildflowers, and pine trees have individual needles rather than compressed, low-res clumps of green.</p><p> You can upgrade and customize your bike, and drifting around corners is fun.</p><p> Character animations also look great. Deacon moves in a way that feels natural and real, whether he’s slitting someone’s throat or sneaking around an enemy camp. The bike is smooth visually and looks good drifting around corners. Even the zombies have their own sort of animalistic movements that give them a creepy, predatory feel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gE-LorHWCGsO4NUFW801LGts5t4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Days-Gone-Zombie-Game-PS4-4-a82aed08ab7a4b29bce78268b729563b.jpg"                      alt="Days Gone"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151868/7443" target="_top" id="2151868">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151868" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151868/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Still-expensive-as-a-newer-release"><a href="#Price-Still-expensive-as-a-newer-release" class="headerlink" title="Price: Still expensive as a newer release"></a><strong>Price: Still expensive as a newer release</strong></h2><p> On the official PlayStation Store, the game goes for $40, but you can regularly find it on sale on Amazon or other online retailers (as of this writing, it’s down to $20). At a discount, Days Gone is an easy purchase, a big, entertaining, open-world zombie romp that rarely if ever stagnates until the credits roll.</p><h2 id="Days-Gone-vs-The-Last-of-Us-Remastered"><a href="#Days-Gone-vs-The-Last-of-Us-Remastered" class="headerlink" title="Days Gone vs. The Last of Us Remastered"></a><strong>Days Gone vs. The Last of Us Remastered</strong></h2><p> There are a fair amount of other zombie survival games out there. On the PlayStation 4, another popular title is The Last of Us Remastered. The Last of Us doesn’t have the expansive open world that Days Gone does, but the crafting system is far better, and the plot is stronger.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Above average, but wait for a sale.</strong></p><p> Days Gone is a game that tried very hard to combine two tropes very much in the entertainment zeitgeist in the past few years—zombies and bikers. It’s graphically strong, with great character animations and detailed environments and character models. The clunky controls and some pacing issues may make recommending it at full price difficult, but on sale, it’s an easy pickup, especially for zombie fans shopping for an entertaining PS4 game.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Days Gone</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Available Platforms  Playstation 4</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-epic-viewership-winners-youtubes-ultimate-list-for-2024/"><u>[New] Epic Viewership Winners YouTube's Ultimate List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-expert-guide-to-shooting-awe-inspiring-igtv-content-on-mobile-and-dslrs/"><u>[Updated] Expert Guide to Shooting Awe-Inspiring IGTV Content on Mobile & DSLRs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-maximize-your-iphone-xs-selfie-potential-top-free-apps/"><u>[Updated] Maximize Your iPhone X's Selfie Potential - Top Free Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/7-ways-to-lock-apps-on-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-and-ipad-securely-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>7 Ways to Lock Apps on Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and iPad Securely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ai-assisted-wellbeing-safe-practices-in-counseling/"><u>AI-Assisted Wellbeing: Safe Practices in Counseling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/asus-zenwifi-ax6600-router-unboxed-and-reviewed-comprehensive-guide-for-a-robust-mesh-network/"><u>ASUS ZenWifi AX6600 Router Unboxed & Reviewed: Comprehensive Guide for a Robust Mesh Network</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/elgoog-unveiled-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-googles-hilarious-rival/"><u>ElgooG Unveiled - A Comprehensive Analysis of Google's Hilarious Rival</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/hp-officejet-5740-windows-11108/"><u>HP OfficeJet 지도 5740: Windows 11/10/8에 호킹 가능</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-syma-107-gs-rc-helicopter-budget-friendly-aerial-fun/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Syma 107 GS RC Helicopter: Budget-Friendly Aerial Fun</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-sound-intervals-techniques-for-manipulating-audio-timestamps-in-final-cut-pro-x/"><u>New 2024 Approved Mastering Sound Intervals Techniques for Manipulating Audio Timestamps in Final Cut Pro X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/take-your-outdoor-viewing-experience-to-new-heights-with-the-55-inch-sealoc-coastal-silver-4k-tv-the-ultimate-guide-and-review/"><u>Take Your Outdoor Viewing Experience to New Heights with the 55-Inch Sealoc Coastal Silver 4K TV - The Ultimate Guide and Review.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-a-light-therapy-clock-spotlight-on-heimvisions-a80s-model-review/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Choosing a Light Therapy Clock: Spotlight on HeimVision's A80S Model Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/unlock-your-disabled-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-without-itunes-in-5-ways-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Unlock Your Disabled Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Without iTunes in 5 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-free-up-space-fast-the-ultimate-fcpx-storage-cleanup-guide/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Free Up Space Fast The Ultimate FCPX Storage Cleanup Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043597/7443" target="_top" id="2043597">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043597" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043597/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068440/7443" target="_top" id="2068440">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068440" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068440/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915810/19272" target="_top" id="1915810">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915810" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915810/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123738/7443" target="_top" id="2123738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037335/7443" target="_top" id="2037335">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037335" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037335/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top"

The underside has a layer of grippy rubber to prevent sliding, so everything stays where it’s supposed to.</p><p> Razer also sells mice and keyboards with Chroma software if you want to make your setup even more coordinated.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 36.22 x 11.57 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Micro-textured cloth |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : RGB |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Non-slip rubber base, light synchronization</p><h2 id="Runner-Up"><a href="#Runner-Up" class="headerlink" title="Runner-Up"></a>Runner-Up</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/553015550" >SteelSeries QcK Prism XL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fdLUdGA45Aj8YOxbW0ZCudg8s24=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/steelseries-qck-prism-xl-gaming-surface-6e9ae015effe48c8ab63fe896fcb1067.jpg" >SteelSeries QcK Prism XL Gaming Surface <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/553015550" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/553015550 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Best buy</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/553015550" >$87 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/6285961.p" >$60 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/Keyboards-&-Mice%255FMouse-Wrist-Pads/78277174?slfpid=3" >$60 at Lenovo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Two-zone RGB lighting</li><li>Works for low and high DPI settings</li><li>Good for gaming</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Not as wide as some other options</li></ul><p> The SteelSeries QcK Prism XL is our runner-up for best overall, but it was a very close call, given this mat has so many solid features at a reasonable price. While 35.4 x 11.8 inches is about an inch narrower than many other pads on our list, this mouse pad is still large enough to fit all your peripherals.</p><p> There are also different sizes if you like the mouse pad but want to go even bigger. All the pads have a micro-woven cloth top to ensure reasonable control in high and low DPI setups. Movement feels smooth and accurate as you play games.</p><p> Some people may find RGB distracting during games. Still, you can set up the two-zone RGB dynamic illumination to provide important in-game information, such as damage, ammo capacity, and more. One negative is that you will need other SteelSeries equipment to utilize PrismSync technology fully.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 35.4 x 11.8 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Cloth top, rubber bottom |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : Two-zone RGB |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : In-game lighting notifications</p><h2 id="Budget-Buy"><a href="#Budget-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Budget Buy"></a>Budget Buy</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01798VS4C?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01798VS4C" >Corsair MM300 Anti-Fray Mouse Pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nZU2Rn-oEYw6t99X5958tFrM0B8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/corsair-mm300-anti-fray-mouse-pad-a95d6e497072429fa82162c9b5b1d90c.jpg" >Corsair MM300 Anti-Fray Mouse Pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01798VS4C?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01798VS4C" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01798VS4C?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01798VS4C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01798VS4C?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01798VS4C" >$30 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Corsair-Gaming-MM300-Anti-Fray-Cloth-Gaming-Mouse-Mat-Extended/52387677?slpfid=3" >$21 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/456522/Corsair-Gaming-MM300-Anti-Fray-Cloth/" >$39 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Optimized for high-DPI gaming mice</li><li>Option for thicker padding</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Strong rubber smell out of the box</li></ul><p> The Corsair MM300 Anti-Fray Mouse Pad measures 36.6 x 11.8 inches and foregoes the ultra-sleek spaceship aesthetic for something more textured. The fabric top has a low-friction weave for precise tracking designed for high-DPI mice (laser and optical).</p><p> The surface has a pre-worn pattern, a little welcome grunge for people who aren’t necessarily about RGB. The edges of the mouse pad have heavy stitching to prevent fraying, and the base is a layer of non-slip rubber, so when you set it on your desk, it stays there.</p><p> These Corsair mouse pads also come in a “Thick” size, which puts 0.2 inches of squishy rubber between your mouse and desk. They’re an excellent option for anyone who wants to smooth over an uneven surface or wants extra cushioning while they game. The price for the number of different options and thickness makes this our pick for the best value.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 36.6 x 11.8 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Cloth |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : None |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Options for extra padding, spill-proof coating</p><h2 id="Splurge"><a href="#Splurge" class="headerlink" title="Splurge"></a>Splurge</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XWW5KTT?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB09XWW5KTT" >Logitech G840 XL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z8-UgXiK3ZjbS5LwJX44cYjMjSA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/logitech-g840-xl-gaming-mousepad-82ab39199d8345758a08234c411032d1.jpg" >Logitech G840 XL Gaming Mousepad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XWW5KTT?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB09XWW5KTT" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XWW5KTT?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB09XWW5KTT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XWW5KTT?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB09XWW5KTT" >$40 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mouse-pads/g840-cloth-xl-gaming-mouse-pad.943-000117.html" >$32 at Logitechg.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Moderate friction for mouse feedback</li><li>Includes carrying case</li><li>Neutral design</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Surface attracts lint</li></ul><p> If you want something with a subtle design, the Logitech G840 XL mouse pad sports an all-black surface with just a hint of blue on the edges.

It even comes with a transport tube.</p><p> While some extra-large mouse pads advertise super low-friction surfaces, slipperiness can make mouse movements feel imprecise or more challenging to control for some gamers. The G840 XL offers moderate friction to give you more feedback on your mouse movements, and the cloth surface is tuned for superior tracking consistency.</p><p> Like several other mouse pads on this list, the G840 XL has a rubber backing that prevents slipping and sliding on your gaming surface.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 36.6 x 15.7 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Cloth surface, rubber bottom |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : None |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Transport tube</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145079/17095" target="_top" id="2145079">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145079" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145079/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Precision"><a href="#Best-for-Precision" class="headerlink" title="Best for Precision"></a>Best for Precision</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5ATZAE/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01G5ATZAE" >ASUS ROG Sheath <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GoGTZn-b8hF20EDxs5zVEQhnxbA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/asus-rog-sheath-extended-gaming-mouse-pad-538728f26a4b4202854815d0a5a17898.jpg" >ASUS ROG Sheath Extended Gaming Mouse Pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5ATZAE/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01G5ATZAE" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5ATZAE/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01G5ATZAE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5ATZAE/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01G5ATZAE" >$30 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54023009" >$30 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.qvc.com/qvc.product.E352558.html?slfpid=3" >$40 at QVC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Low-profile stitched edges</li><li>Very durable surface</li><li>Larger size than most</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Tends to slide a bit</li></ul><p> This ROG Sheath mouse pad from ASUS is a bit larger than most of the options on this list, measuring 35.4 x 17.3 inches and about 0.12 inches thick, but it’s all about precision. The woven surface makes for precise mouse tracking and minimal friction. Even the stitched borders are as low-profile as possible to prevent that bumper car effect if your mouse gets too close to the edge. That stitching also guards against fraying.</p><p> The ROG Sheath has undergone lots of durability testing to ensure that the pad’s surface will hold up under repeated swipes of your mouse. It’s also temperature resistant (up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) to withstand even the hottest PC. The one downside is that this pad is lightweight enough to slide around a bit with a smooth desk surface. It has a rubber backing to cut down on this kind of movement.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 35.4 x 17.3 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Cloth top, rubber bottom |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : None |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Stitched edges</p><h2 id="Best-for-Speed"><a href="#Best-for-Speed" class="headerlink" title="Best for Speed"></a>Best for Speed</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/HyperX-4P5Q8AA-Fury-S-XL-Gaming-Mouse-Pad/106007410?slfpid=3" >HyperX Fury S Speed Edition XL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jAXq76RQVfP3cnaSWNozlSy-5jk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/hyperx-fury-s-speed-edition-xl-ac4077d3e54741479b238c547caf645d.jpg" >HyperX Fury S Speed Edition XL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/HyperX-4P5Q8AA-Fury-S-XL-Gaming-Mouse-Pad/106007410?slfpid=3" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/HyperX-4P5Q8AA-Fury-S-XL-Gaming-Mouse-Pad/106007410?slfpid=3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/HyperX-4P5Q8AA-Fury-S-XL-Gaming-Mouse-Pad/106007410?slfpid=3" >View on Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Anti-fray edges</li><li>Optimized for optical mouse tracking</li><li>Durable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Surface might be too slippery for some</li></ul><p> The Fury S mouse pad from HyperX is available in different sizes and color options.

We chose the Extended XL Spill-proof version for our selection of best for durability. The Corsair MM350 is a good size, measuring 36.6 x 15.7 inches, and has an ideal thickness of 0.15 inches, which is definitely on the thicker end for most mouse pads.</p><p> There are stitched edges that hold up to the movements of your arms and prevent the edges from fraying. However, over a long period of use, you may see some mild edge fraying, but you likely won’t see fraying on the actual mouse pad surface. The spill-proof and stain-resistant coating works well and will wipe clean easily.</p><p> The bottom has a rubber coating to prevent slipping, which works as it should, especially considering the heavier weight of the pad has to it. Overall, this mouse pad should last you for a long time and go through many gaming sessions.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 36.6 x 15.7 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Micro-weave cloth fabric |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : None |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Spill-proof and stain-resistant coating</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Value"><a href="#Best-Value" class="headerlink" title="Best Value"></a>Best Value</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885FJ8CB/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB0885FJ8CB" >Razer Gigantus v2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HQ3LX4yyYuicmc2i2Z7fURhMwIc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/razer-gigantus-v2-gaming-mouse-pad-efe4cdde2f914057b5107aa40e7d31a9.jpg" >Razer Gigantus v2 Gaming Mouse Pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885FJ8CB/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB0885FJ8CB" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885FJ8CB/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB0885FJ8CB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885FJ8CB/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB0885FJ8CB" >$27 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Razer-Gigantus-V2-Cloth-Gaming-Mouse-Pad-XXL-Thick-High-Density-Foam-Non-Slip-Base-Non-Slip-Base-Classic-Black/486130680?slfpid=3" >$27 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/6417112.p" >$27 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Simple, clean design</li><li>Thick</li><li>Customizable through Razer website</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No stitched edge</li></ul><p> When purchasing a budget extended mouse pad, you want to feel like you’re getting the best quality possible for a lower price and not buying a cheap imitation. The Razer Gigantus V2 retails at $30 for the XXL version, but it still feels like Razer made it with great care and quality.</p><p> The Gigantus V2 measures 37 x 10.83 inches and has a thickness of 0.15 inches, which feels comfortable under your arms. The textured micro-weave surface has the right balance between grip and slide for your mouse, ensuring accuracy, while the rubber anti-slip base holds everything in place.</p><p> The mouse pad has a simple black and green look, but the Razer website allows you to pick a design you like and add your Gamertag for fun.

High-DPI gamers often prefer low friction because it allows precise movement and speed.</p><p> But there are no hard and fast rules. If you like to “feel” the gaming surface under your mouse, look for something slightly more texture.

The pad prevents the mouse from being damaged by rubbing over your desk surface and also protects your desk from wear and tear from the mouse. Most mice today are either<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/whats-the-difference-between-optical-and-laser-mice-2640209" >optical or laser mice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and their sensors can read mouse pad material better than other surfaces like wood or glass.</li><li>Are extended mouse pads worth it?<br> Absolutely. An extended mouse pad will prevent your mouse from running off the edge of your mouse pad when you’re excitedly playing a match, and it will also hold up to more wear than a standard mouse pad. These mousepads also provide excellent protection for your desk and are a great look for your gaming station.</li><li>What mouse pad do pro gamers use?<br> Many pro gamers are sponsored so that they will use a brand of mouse pad affiliated with their sponsorship. However, pro gamers may prefer extended mouse pads for comfort and performance. If you like a flash appearance, a mousepad with RGB lighting always lends a bit of style.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamline-your-tech-expertise-with-io-screen-recording/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Streamline Your Tech Expertise with IO Screen Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-avoidance-tactics-for-edg-vids-in-learning-for-2024/"><u>[New] Avoidance Tactics for EDG Vids in Learning for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-get-clipped-onto-youtube-audio-submission-made-easy-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Get Clipped Onto YouTube Audio Submission Made Easy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/affordable-elegance-a-detailed-review-of-motorola-one-an-alternative-to-the-iphone/"><u>Affordable Elegance: A Detailed Review of Motorola One - An Alternative to the iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/asus-ac68u-router-analysis-fast-and-safe-5g-wireless-performance/"><u>Asus AC68U Router Analysis: Fast & Safe 5G Wireless Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/choose-research-methods-and-tools/"><u>Choose Research Methods and Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-nintendo-switch-analysis-a-top-contender-in-handheld-gaming/"><u>Comprehensive Nintendo Switch Analysis: A Top Contender in Handheld Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/eliminate-screen-hiccup-in-win11/"><u>Eliminate Screen Hiccup in Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/embark-on-a-detective-journey-with-4-innovative-ai-enhanced-murder-mystery-games-online/"><u>Embark on a Detective Journey with 4 Innovative, AI-Enhanced Murder Mystery Games Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/gratuit-online-nsv-naar-mpeg-omzetten-expertise-van-movavi/"><u>Gratuit Online NSV Naar MPEG Omzetten - Expertise Van Movavi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-or-bypass-knox-enrollment-service-on-sony-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Remove or Bypass Knox Enrollment Service On Sony</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-backward-in-time-reversing-youtube-media/"><u>In 2024, Step Backward in Time Reversing YouTube Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/interactive-guide-experience-the-versatile-features-of-msis-portable-pro-display-mp161e2/"><u>Interactive Guide: Experience the Versatile Features of MSI's Portable Pro Display - MP161E2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/motorola-mg7700-evaluation-harmonizing-swift-execution-with-trustworthiness/"><u>Motorola MG7700 Evaluation: Harmonizing Swift Execution with Trustworthiness</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/premium-tablet-face-off-can-you-afford-to-compromise-on-your-apple-ipad-air-4-or-samsung-galaxy-tab-s7plus/"><u>Premium Tablet Face-Off: Can You Afford to Compromise on Your Apple iPad Air 4 or Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/rca-video-doorbell-comprehensive-review-of-an-efficient-security-camera/"><u>RCA Video Doorbell: Comprehensive Review of an Efficient Security Camera</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-definitive-guide-to-the-razer-blade-pro-17-a-pocket-sized-performance-giant/"><u>The Definitive Guide to the Razer Blade Pro 17: A Pocket-Sized Performance Giant</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/unlocking-instagram-potential-a-comprehensible-guide-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Instagram Potential A Comprehensible Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-hidden-delights-in-yokus-island-express-an-in-depth-review/"><u>Unveiling the Hidden Delights in Yoku's Island Express: An In-Depth Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This opens up a wealth of opportunities from nifty editing tricks to easily capturing<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/virtual-reality-vr-definition-4155090" >VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> experiences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111964/7443" target="_top" id="2111964">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111964" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111964/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-chunky-waterproof-build"><a href="#Design-A-chunky-waterproof-build" class="headerlink" title="Design: A chunky, waterproof build"></a>Design: A chunky, waterproof build</h2><p> The Insta360 One X2 is a solid, chunky little rectangle. It’s compact enough to fit in a large pocket and feels quite rugged and durable, though those bulbous glass lens elements mean you’ll still want to be a little careful with it. Fortunately, it comes with a sleek neoprene case that offers a reassuring extra level of protection when you just want to carry the camera in your pocket.</p><p> The One X2 is fully waterproof down to 33 feet, which is a big improvement over its more sensitive predecessor.</p><p> Insta360 also includes a microfiber cloth, which is certainly useful, given the tendency for those lenses to attract smudges and dust. You also get a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> cable for charging, though a charging brick isn’t included.</p><p> The One X2 is fully waterproof down to 33 feet, which is a big improvement over its more sensitive predecessor. In order to accomplish this waterproofing, the battery compartment and USB port feature locking sealed doors. The locking mechanisms were a little tricky to open and close, but that’s a worthy trade-off for waterproofing. The battery doubles as the door to the battery compartment, and the microSD card slot is located within that compartment.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Controls consist of a shutter button, power button, and circular touchscreen. An<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> light indicates the camera’s status, and there is a standard tripod mount on the underside of the camera.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Mostly-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Mostly-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Mostly straightforward"></a>Setup Process: Mostly straightforward</h2><p> The One X2 came partially charged and ready to go once I inserted a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-sd-cards-to-buy-4072362" >microSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , though first I had to install the Insta360 app on my phone and activate the camera. This turned out to be a bit of a pain, with the Bluetooth connection used to activate the One X2 and set up the Wi-Fi connection repeatedly timing out and failing. Eventually, I got it up and running, and aside from the one hiccup, the process was fairly smooth, if more complex than I’d typically expect from a camera.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014850/22899" target="_top" id="2014850">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014850" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014850/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Good-light-a-necessity"><a href="#Image-Quality-Good-light-a-necessity" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Good light a necessity"></a>Image Quality: Good light a necessity</h2><p> My initial impressions of the Insta360 One X2 were tinted by the weather conditions in which I initially tested it. Here in Western Washington, winter can be gloomy and dark, so I ended up shooting in fairly dim conditions much of the time. As a result, I couldn’t help be shocked by how poor the video looked when I went to edit it. However, when given plenty of light to work with, the One X2 produced fairly decent-looking photos and video.</p><p> You really don’t have to worry about getting a stable shot even when walking or running on rough ground.</p><p> What’s really impressive is the degree of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optical-and-digital-image-stabilization-488000" >image stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that’s possible in this camera. It’s good enough that you really don’t have to worry about getting a stable shot even when walking or running on rough ground. With this in mind, you have to consider the Insta360 from a perspective of the intended purpose. Action cameras have always been action-focused, and this is even more true of 360 action cameras. Basically, you need to do something interesting that justifies the trade-offs.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> One thing to remember about the One X2 is that its 5.7K recording resolution isn’t as sharp and detailed as you might expect, and when you crop down to a standard 16:9 frame you end up with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-the-term-1080p-means-1846837" >1080p <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . That’s good enough for viewing on a phone or small tablet, but the low resolution, as well as noise and image artifacts, become pretty significant when viewed on a large computer monitor.</p><h2 id="Audio-Unimpressive-overall"><a href="#Audio-Unimpressive-overall" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Unimpressive overall"></a>Audio: Unimpressive overall</h2><p> The audio recording on the One X2 could be charitably described as mediocre. It’s there, and it’s useable, but in a camera that would otherwise be well suited to vlogging, given its portable size and ease of use, it’s a little disappointing.</p><h2 id="Storage-Requirements-Hefty-file-size"><a href="#Storage-Requirements-Hefty-file-size" class="headerlink" title="Storage Requirements: Hefty file size"></a>Storage Requirements: Hefty file size</h2><p> Though it may be the bare minimum for decent 360 footage, the 5.7L video footage the One X2 captures is still highly demanding in how much storage space it requires. A single short video clip easily takes up hundreds of megabytes of space, so you’ll want a big microSD card and plenty of hard drive space on your PC and&#x2F;or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Software-Brilliant-but-buggy"><a href="#Software-Brilliant-but-buggy" class="headerlink" title="Software: Brilliant but buggy"></a>Software: Brilliant but buggy</h2><p> Most of my problems with the One X2 have to do with the Insta360 app, and the big one is with the difficulty of connecting to the camera. Every time I connected to the One X2, I had to tap the connect button in the app over and over again until it finally connected.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Once it’s connected, the app is rather cleverly designed with a basic but well-conceived, remote viewing and control interface and a brilliant editing suite for processing 360 videos. From framing your shot and changing playback speed to creating camera movements using keyframes, it’s an effective and highly intuitive tool that allows you to quickly and easily process your videos on the go.</p><p> The software on the One X2 itself is quite basic, but considering the small size of its circular touchscreen, this is understandable.</p><p> The app also includes a fully functional social media platform where you can share your work and interact with other creators. Really, there’s a lot bundled into the Insta360 app, and fortunately, every aspect of the app includes extensive tutorials, though the text in some of these tutorials has not been translated into English.</p><p> The software on the One X2 itself is quite basic, but considering the small size of its circular touchscreen, this is understandable. However, as a result of the lack of accessible settings in the camera, I ended up frequently going back into the app on my phone to tweak things in the camera. This made the connection issues I experienced all the more annoying.</p><p> It’s also possible to take more control of your video editing on the computer via either Insta360’s free editing studio software or via a plugin in Adobe Premiere. However, it was easier to get the shots I wanted by editing them on my phone via the app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148772/18498" target="_top" id="2148772">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148772" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148772/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Accessories-A-good-amount-of-options"><a href="#Accessories-A-good-amount-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: A good amount of options"></a>Accessories: A good amount of options</h2><p> A number of accessories are available for the Insta360 One X2. These include, among others, a diving enclosure and a “bullet time” attachment used to twirl the One X2 around your head. It’s also a good idea to have a selfie stick to use with the One X2, and I found a tripod handy for recording timelapse videos.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144285/7443" target="_top" id="2144285">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144285" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144285/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a>Price: Good value</h2><p> With an MSRP of $430, the One X2 is only a little more expensive than a high-end action camera, but it’s not bad for a 360 camera. It’s a good value if being able to shoot 360-degree video is a necessity for you.</p><h2 id="Insta360-One-X2-vs-GoPro-Hero-9-Black"><a href="#Insta360-One-X2-vs-GoPro-Hero-9-Black" class="headerlink" title="Insta360 One X2 vs. GoPro Hero 9 Black"></a>Insta360 One X2 vs. GoPro Hero 9 Black</h2><p> You may well be trying to decide between a 360 camera and a traditional action camera, in which case the obvious choice to match against the Insta360 One X2 is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/gopro-hero9-black-review-5120078" >GoPro HERO9 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . On the surface, the GoPro looks like the obvious choice for far better image and audio quality with better durability at a lower price point. However, if what you want is to record special moments in your life without having to even think about the camera, then you should go with the One X2.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Despite its flaws, the Insta360 One X2 offers easy 360-degree recording in a waterproof package.</strong></p><p> I had something of a rough start with the Insta360 One X2, but after dealing with setup issues and a steep learning curve, its small size, lightweight, and ease of use made up for its flaws It’s ideal for capturing videos in circumstances where you can’t be bothered to film with a traditional camera.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/gopro-hero9-black-review-5120078" >GoPro HERO9 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/akaso-ek7000-pro-4k-action-camera-review-4770265" >AKASO EK7000 Pro 4K Action Camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/gopro-hero7-black-review-4705929" >GoPro HERO7 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  One X2</li><li>Product Brand  Insta360</li><li>MPN  CINOSXX&#x2F;A</li><li>Price  $430.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Weight  5.3 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.8 x 1.2 x 4.4 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Sensor  2x 1&#x2F;2.3-inch CMOS</li><li>Lens  2x 7.2mm f2 (35mm equivalent)</li><li>Storage  MicroSD (u3&#x2F;v30 or faster recommended)</li><li>Microphone  Yes</li><li>ISO  100-3200</li><li>Display  1.33-inch touchscreen</li><li>Recording Resolution  5.7K 360-degree auto stitched capture</li><li>Waterproof  33 feet</li><li>Operating Temperature  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li>Connectivity  Wi-Fi</li><li>Battery  1630 mAh</li><li>Charging  USB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-finding-inner-voice-how-to-confidently-share-stories-online/"><u>[Updated] Finding Inner Voice How to Confidently Share Stories Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-top-20-free-unlicensed-pubg-screenshot-compilations/"><u>[Updated] Top 20 Free Unlicensed PUBG Screenshot Compilations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-link-sounds-to-visual-elements-in-ppt/"><u>2024 Approved Link Sounds to Visual Elements in PPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/barnes-and-nobles-nook-glowlight-3-unveiled-an-expert-review-on-its-stellar-nighttime-performance/"><u>Barnes & Noble's Nook GlowLight 3 Unveiled: An Expert Review on Its Stellar Nighttime Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/become-a-facetime-pro-skype-call-basics-for-mobile-users-for-2024/"><u>Become a Facetime Pro Skype Call Basics for Mobile Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/conquering-hearts-and-kingdoms-a-detailed-review-of-the-epic-adventure-in-assassincuadra-valkyrie/"><u>Conquering Hearts and Kingdoms: A Detailed Review of The Epic Adventure in Assassin'cuadra Valkyrie</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/conquering-history-through-gaming-a-comprehensive-review-of-imperator-rome/"><u>Conquering History Through Gaming: A Comprehensive Review of 'Imperator: Rome'</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/fitbit-charge-4-insights-the-ultimate-harmony-of-style-and-effectiveness/"><u>Fitbit Charge 4 Insights: The Ultimate Harmony of Style and Effectiveness</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-iphone-7-without-losing-any-data-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Upgrade iPhone 7 without Losing Any Data?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Amplifi HD is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mesh-wi-fi-network-systems-4139748" >Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a main router and separate mesh points that serve as satellite routers. The Amplifi system is supposed to extend Wi-Fi range, reduce dead zones, and provide better coverage. To see how Ubiquiti’s mesh system holds up to the demands of a household with multiple devices, I connected the Amplifi HD in my test home that contains roughly 50 Wi-Fi connected devices.</p><h2 id="Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points"><a href="#Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points" class="headerlink" title="Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points"></a><strong>Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD Mesh System comes with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >long-range router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and two satellite mesh points. The router has a unique design. It’s small, cube-shaped, and it looks more like an alarm clock or smart display than a router. It doesn’t have antennas protruding from it as you see on most routers.</p><p> The router measures 3.9 inches by 3.9 inches and its matte white with an LCD touchscreen and a light around the bottom perimeter. The router is stylish, yet unassuming. You can set it on a table or entertainment center, and it’ll go unnoticed.</p><p> The two satellite points are very simplistic. They are basic looking, oval-shaped devices with no ports. They plug into a wall outlet, and they have indicator lights to tell you the signal strength. The mesh points, aside from being the same matte-white color, don’t match very well with the main router. Fortunately, they sit in different areas of the home, so the mismatched design doesn’t have too much impact on the overall aesthetic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/s87ZCkRIGWmpbjF2kUOXJRQtOl4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amplifi_LongRangeRouters_HD_02-1a111a806ad7495ba9f36d51121fe5b0.jpg"                      alt="Amplifi HD"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier"><a href="#Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Couldn’t get any easier"></a><strong>Setup: Couldn’t get any easier</strong></h2><p> The setup for the Amplifi HD system is probably the easiest setup process I’ve encountered. The app walks you through the process step-by-step, with pictures to guide you on each instruction. The most difficult part was deciding where to place the two mesh points in my test home. I placed one in the far bedroom and one in my office, two rooms that notoriously experience drop-offs.</p><p> By default, the app creates a dual (2.4 and 5Ghz) network, which directs traffic based on the most efficient pathways. You can create separate 2.4 and 5Ghz networks, or make other adjustments as you see fit though. You can change the band on the mesh points (from 2.4 to 5Ghz), create additional SSIDs, and more. For the purpose of testing, I used the default combined network and allowed the system to direct network traffic between bands.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938693/19272" target="_top" id="1938693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938693/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices"><a href="#Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices"></a><strong>Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD system is not Wi-Fi 6 capable.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-standards-802-11a-802-11b-g-n-and-802-11ac-816553" >It has 802.11ac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s backwards compatible. On the back of the router sit four gigabit LAN ports in addition to the WAN connection. There’s no multigig port, but the four ports were a welcome addition.</p><p> The Amplifi HD seems to be designed for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >optimal signal range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as opposed to device quantity. This is an ideal system for someone with a large area to cover, but it’s not a powerhouse capable of managing an army of devices like the Nighthawk AX12 or the TP-Link Archer AX6000. The Amplifi system thrives in terms of its ability to push a signal over a long distance, as it can cover areas up to 20,000 square feet. The Amplifi system doesn’t exactly thrive in its ability to manage dozens of devices simultaneously.</p><p> In my test home, speeds from my ISP max out at 500 Mbps. In the same room as the main router, Ookla measured the speed at 131 Mbps. The speed remained consistent throughout the home, even in rooms that typically experience drop offs with other routers. However, outside in the backyard, the speed reduced to 111 Mbps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082542/7443" target="_top" id="2082542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-A-display-screen"><a href="#Key-Features-A-display-screen" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A display screen"></a><strong>Key Features: A display screen</strong></h2><p> The touchscreen on the front of the main router can display the time, total GB, WAN and Router IP addresses, internet speeds, and port statuses. You touch the screen to cycle through the different screen options. The power cable connects via<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and there’s a USB 2.0 port as well, but it doesn’t allow you to connect an external hard drive (the port is reserved for future use).</p><p> Since the Amplifi HD is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it can self-heal, manage network traffic, and you can manage your network through the companion app.</p><p> The app creates a dual (2.4 and 5Ghz) network, which directs traffic based on the most efficient pathways.</p><h2 id="Software-Amplifi-App"><a href="#Software-Amplifi-App" class="headerlink" title="Software: Amplifi App"></a><strong>Software: Amplifi App</strong></h2><p> In the Amplifi App, you can set up a guest network, manage devices, pause the internet, check the health of the system, and check your speeds on your entire network and on individual devices. You can optimize the priority level for each of your devices between normal, streaming, or gaming.</p><p> You can also set up parental controls and control your system remotely. The app is extremely user friendly and simple to navigate. There are a few more advanced features, like assigning static IPs and port forwarding, but overall the app is designed for the average user.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2X1DxWPlS1VXqnwsUCG5qviJXwc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amplifi_LongRangeRouters_HD_03-56584e48b76942519745c71443c2e8d5.jpg"                      alt="Amplifi HD"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Price-A-little-steep"><a href="#Price-A-little-steep" class="headerlink" title="Price: A little steep"></a><strong>Price: A little steep</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD system isn’t cheap. The package I tested, which came with the router and two mesh points, retails for $340. You can find mesh systems for much less, and of course, some mesh systems are much more expensive. But, the Amplifi system’s design, easy setup, and feature set help justify the price.</p><h2 id="Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi"></a><strong>Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p> A Nest Wi-Fi package sells for around the same price as the Amplifi system. However, with the Nest system, all of the components match, while the Amplifi router looks very different from its mesh points. The Nest system points also serve as Google Assistant speakers, and the system features some more advanced technologies (like WPA3 encryption). However, one big issue with the Nest system is that it only has two Ethernet ports, while the Amplifi router has four spare ports.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Looks better than it performs.</strong></p><p> The Amplifi HD mesh system is attractive and does provide coverage for a huge area, but it doesn’t deliver lightning-fast speeds in a home with dozens of connected devices.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Amplifi HD Mesh Wi-Fi System</li><li>Product Brand  Ubiquiti</li><li>Price  $340.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.9 x 3.9 x 3.9 in.</li><li>Aggregate Speed  5.25 Gbps</li><li>Security  WPA2</li><li>Warranty  One year</li><li>Wi-Fi standards  802.11ac</li><li>MIMO  3 x 3</li><li>IPv6 compatible  Yes</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  4 Gigabit LAN ports</li><li>Range  20,000 square feet</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li><li>Remote connect  Yes</li><li>What’s included  Amplifi HD Router, two mesh points, power and Ethernet cables, guides</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-formulating-gripping-narratives-for-your-vlogs/"><u>[New] Formulating Gripping Narratives for Your Vlogs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-revolutionizing-patient-engagement-with-creative-fb-strategies/"><u>[New] Revolutionizing Patient Engagement with Creative FB Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-successful-srt-shipping-out-of-premiere-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking Successful SRT Shipping Out of Premiere for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-eight-high-res-cinematography-systems/"><u>2024 Approved Best Eight High-Res Cinematography Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-the-lenovo-chromebook-duet-a-cost-effective-and-versatile-2-in-1-laptop-alternative/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to the Lenovo Chromebook Duet: A Cost-Effective and Versatile 2-in-1 Laptop Alternative</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/elevate-your-macbook-pro-installing-an-ssd/"><u>Elevate Your MacBook Pro: Installing an SSD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-swiftly-sync-your-visual-content-across-ios-devices/"><u>In 2024, Swiftly Sync Your Visual Content Across iOS Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/mastering-device-compatibility-fix-your-pcs-casting-problem-in-the-latest-windows-10-update/"><u>Mastering Device Compatibility: Fix Your PC's Casting Problem in the Latest Windows 10 Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/mastering-mayhem-in-the-kitchen-an-insightful-review-of-overcooked-2/"><u>Mastering Mayhem in the Kitchen: An Insightful Review of Overcooked! 2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/securely-deploy-powertoys-in-win11-environments/"><u>Securely Deploy PowerToys in Win11 Environments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/solving-your-windows-10-headphone-issues-a-comprehensive-fix/"><u>Solving Your Windows 10 Headphone Issues - A Comprehensive Fix</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-lg-gram-17-revealed-how-this-lightweight-powerhouse-redefines-performance-laptops-expert-review/"><u>The LG Gram 17 Revealed: How This Lightweight Powerhouse Redefines Performance Laptops - Expert Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-perfect-blend-of-features-in-google-pixel-4a-an-essential-guide/"><u>The Perfect Blend of Features in Google Pixel 4a - An Essential Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-film-enthusiasts-index-top-7-destinations-for-watching-upcoming-trailers/"><u>The Ultimate Film Enthusiast’s Index: Top 7 Destinations for Watching Upcoming Trailers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/the-vive-cosmos-unveiled-top-tier-virtual-reality-headset-with-tough-contenders/"><u>The Vive Cosmos Unveiled: Top-Tier Virtual Reality Headset with Tough Contenders</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Eero Pro Mesh Wi-Fi system is a Wi-Fi networking solution that makes use of a base station router and remote beacons to extend your wireless network throughout your home or office. It’s a remarkably flexible system that allows you to use multiple Eero Pro routers, a single Eero Pro router and multiple beacons, or whatever configuration works best for your circumstances.</p><p> Mesh router systems can be tricky to set up and use, so we recently took an Eero Pro and a couple of beacons home to see how they work under real-world conditions. We checked things like wired and wireless speed, ease of setup and use, range, and more. Keep reading to find out the results of our exhaustive testing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vS5n544wcZEvyycOPsM5iPB7dpk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4140134_EeroPro-3-75fe2f82937940d48f1a6de9205b0f9f.jpg"                      alt="Eero Pro Mesh Wi-Fi System"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043855/7443" target="_top" id="2043855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Design-Understated-and-easy-to-fit-in-with-most-decors"><a href="#Design-Understated-and-easy-to-fit-in-with-most-decors" class="headerlink" title="Design: Understated and easy to fit in with most decors"></a><strong>Design: Understated and easy to fit in with most decors</strong></h2><p> The Eero Pro is a mesh system that allows you to use a couple of modular components to build out a wireless network that works with your living space or office. The main component is the Eero Pro router itself, which is a sleek little unit that’s significantly smaller than most routers. It’s also a lot simpler, with just one indicator light, no external ports or antennas, and only two Ethernet ports.</p><p> In addition to the Eero Pro router, you can also mix and match Eero beacons in with your system. The beacons share the same sleek white design aesthetic, and they’re even simpler. Each beacon is designed to be plugged directly into a power outlet, and they don’t have any Ethernet ports at all.</p><p> In the configuration we tested, we set up a basic network with a single Eero Pro and then connected two beacons. Depending on the layout of your home or office, you can stick with just a single beacon, add multiple beacons, or even use multiple Eero Pro routers, with the additional units in bridge mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pGn5ftrLbUu_97xnS8kZVcV7DvY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4140134_EeroPro-2-e8f8a2f558b54c20b642da56818884aa.jpg"                      alt="Eero Pro Mesh Wi-Fi System"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Possibly-the-easiest-Wi-Fi-mesh-system-you’ll-ever-use"><a href="#Setup-Process-Possibly-the-easiest-Wi-Fi-mesh-system-you’ll-ever-use" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Possibly the easiest Wi-Fi mesh system you’ll ever use"></a><strong>Setup Process: Possibly the easiest Wi-Fi mesh system you’ll ever use</strong></h2><p> If you’ve hesitated to set up your own wireless network, or shied away from mesh networks, because it seems too complicated, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the Eero Pro. The entire setup process is accomplished with the help of a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >smartphone app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that walks you through every step, and the overall experience is one of the easiest we’ve ever seen.</p><p> You can place your Eero Pro and beacons wherever you want, but the app is designed to help you find the optimum locations. You can even tell the app how many floors you have and choose a floor plan that looks similar to your home to receive customized suggestions.</p><p> When you place each Eero beacon, the app automatically tests to see if the placement will work. We received the go ahead on our first try in each case, but it’s nice that the app has the ability to let you know if you might have placement issues.</p><p> The one issue with Eero that may bother some people is that you have to sign up for an account during the setup process. This includes providing Eero with your phone number so that they can send you a confirmation code. It was a quick and easy process, but it was a bit of an annoyance all the same.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Tri-band-base-stations-and-dual-band-beacons"><a href="#Connectivity-Tri-band-base-stations-and-dual-band-beacons" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Tri-band base stations and dual-band beacons"></a><strong>Connectivity: Tri-band base stations and dual-band beacons</strong></h2><p> The Eero Pro is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> tri-band router that broadcasts one 2.4GHz channel and two 5GHz channels, and the beacons are dual-band with one 2.4 GHz and one 5GHz channel each. Unlike most routers, Eero does not provide an AC rating for the Eero Pro. They do, however, give some numbers.</p><p> According to Eero, their maximum rated transmit speeds are 240 Mbps at 2.4GHz and 600Mbps at 5GHz. That would make the tri-band Eero Pro an AC1440 device, which is on the low side for a router in this price range.</p><p> The issue, of course, is that a router with a massive AC rating won’t necessarily reach those numbers in the real world, and the point of a product like the Eero Pro is to create a large mesh network rather than provide the highest possible speed from a single access point.</p><p> The biggest shortfall of the Eero Pro, in terms of connectivity, is that it only has two ethernet ports.</p><p> The Eero Pro does support MU-MIMO, which is a technology that’s designed to seamlessly provide the highest possible connection speeds to devices that use different underlying wireless technologies. You even have the option to broadcast a single Wi-Fi network ID for all of your devices to connect to, so you don’t have to choose between the 2.4GHz network for distance or the 5GHz network for speed.</p><p> The biggest shortfall of the Eero Pro, in terms of connectivity, is that it only has two Ethernet ports. One connects the router to your modem, and the other can be connected to a device like a computer to provide a wired internet connection. If you want to connect other devices via Ethernet, you’ll need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-network-switch-817588" >network switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/L8g27SmIGtD8G-19FjJtPqPeQIQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4140134_EeroPro-4-5e47062bd2f141d69819fa37cf2c1899.jpg"                      alt="Eero Pro Mesh Wi-Fi System"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Network-Performance-Wireless-coverage-is-great-but-a-little-slow"><a href="#Network-Performance-Wireless-coverage-is-great-but-a-little-slow" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Wireless coverage is great but a little slow"></a><strong>Network Performance: Wireless coverage is great but a little slow</strong></h2><p> We tested network throughput performance on a Mediacom gigabit internet connection, testing both the wired Ethernet connection and the automatic system that’s designed to automatically switch between 2.4GHz and 5GHz based on speed and performance.</p><p> When connected to the Eero Pro via a wired connection, we averaged about 937Mbps over several tests. The wired connection obviously isn’t the main attraction here, in a Wi-Fi mesh system, but it’s worth noting that this is one of the fastest wired speeds we’ve seen out of the various routers we’ve tested using the same connection and hardware.</p><p> Using the wireless system, without any beacons connected, we averaged 265Mbps down and 67Mbps up with our test device about three feet from the router. This is significantly slower than other 5GHz routers we’ve tested on this connection, but it’s still plenty fast enough for streaming 4K video, playing games, and other similar purposes.</p><p> If you need to extend your Wi-Fi network through a very large space, or you have a history of Wi-Fi dead zones, our hands-on testing shows that the Eero Pro can get the job done.</p><p> We performed our next test about 15 feet from the router, with no beacons connected, with a closed door between the router and our test device. We saw the exact same download speed at that distance, and a slightly lower upload speed of about 63Mbps.</p><p> Our next test was performed 30 feet from the router, with no beacons connected, and two walls between the router and the device. At that distance, our download speed dropped to an average of about 210Mbps, while the upload remained unchanged.</p><p> With beacons connected, we were able to maintain the baseline 265Mbps connection speed throughout the entirety of our roughly 1,800 square foot space. We even installed a beacon in an RV parked about 50 feet from the router when we had visitors while we were testing this system, successfully extending the same baseline connection speed out there.</p><p> If you have a large house with multiple floors, or you suffer from strange Wi-Fi dead zones, we’re confident that the Eero Pro and enough beacons should do the trick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/W25qxNjZ6Kuufukkif19R-eKC_Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4140134_EeroPro-5-e47c4a1838934bf7a139c76cc161dad9.jpg"                      alt="Eero Pro Mesh Wi-Fi System"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Software-Fantastic-phone-app-no-web-interface"><a href="#Software-Fantastic-phone-app-no-web-interface" class="headerlink" title="Software: Fantastic phone app, no web interface"></a><strong>Software: Fantastic phone app, no web interface</strong></h2><p> Eero provides a smartphone app that you can install on your iPhone or Android device. You need the app to set the network up initially, and you also have to use the app to manage the network later on. The app is very easy to understand and use, but it is important to note that this is the only method of managing your Eero Pro. Most routers have a web interface, but Eero doesn’t.</p><p> The Eero Pro system is designed to be just about as simple and user-friendly as possible, and that extends to the app. It’s very clean, with a home screen that displays your top devices by usage, the status of each Eero Pro and beacon in your system, and the latest internet speed tests. This information is very easy to digest, even if you aren’t a networking expert.</p><p> The Eero Pro system is designed to be just about as simple and user-friendly as possible, and that extends to the app.</p><p> The internet connection speed section is primarily aimed at users who aren’t sure how fast their connection needs to be. The system runs tests on a regular basis, with the option to test manually, and provides a little message about the types of activities you can do with that speed. For example, with our gigabit connection, Eero let us know that we could expect to stream 4K video, use video chat apps, and stream games on multiple devices. For a layman, this is all very useful information.</p><p> The app also allows you to customize your network, although some features are locked behind a subscription. For example, you can’t set a custom DNS without subscribing to Eero Secure.</p><p> Eero Secure is a subscription service that you receive a free trial for when you first set up your network. It automatically scans for problems, blocks threats, and blocks ads at the DNS level, and you can see details about what it has blocked through the app. It also has content filters and parental controls, but we’ll address that in the next section.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Parental-Controls-Advanced-features-require-a-subscription"><a href="#Parental-Controls-Advanced-features-require-a-subscription" class="headerlink" title="Parental Controls: Advanced features require a subscription"></a><strong>Parental Controls: Advanced features require a subscription</strong></h2><p> Eero Pro comes with powerful built-in parental controls that you manage through the app. It works by creating profiles for each member of your family, assigning devices to those profiles, and then placing content blocks and scheduling internet pauses for your kids if you don’t want them getting online during homework time or in the middle of the night.</p><p> The built-in parental controls are great, but the catch is you have to pay extra for this feature.

The catch is that those routers may offer superior performance in some areas, but they don’t offer the flexibility of a mesh system.</p><p> If you need to extend your Wi-Fi network through a very large space, or you have a history of Wi-Fi dead zones, our hands-on testing shows that the Eero Pro can get the job done. That makes it well worth the price, although it isn’t the only mesh system on the market.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111967/7443" target="_top" id="2111967">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111967" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111967/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Eero-Pro-vs-Netgear-Orbi"><a href="#Eero-Pro-vs-Netgear-Orbi" class="headerlink" title="Eero Pro vs. Netgear Orbi"></a><strong>Eero Pro vs. Netgear Orbi</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Orbi is one of the closest competitors to the Eero Pro, and there’s a lot to like about both systems. The Orbi is a lot more complicated than the Eero Pro, as you have more choices. The closest to the system we tested is their RBK33 system, which has an MSRP of $300. Like the Eero Pro system we tested, the RBK33 comes with an Orbi router and two plug-in satellites.</p><p> Pricing is similar, with the Orbi coming in a bit cheaper, but the Orbi router actually comes with some features you don’t get with the Eero Pro. For example, the Orbi router includes four Ethernet ports compared to just two on the Eero Pro. The Orbi router also includes a sync button, which is something you don’t have to worry about with the Eero Pro.</p><p> With Eero, the whole point is to make things as simple and easy as possible. You plug in a router or beacon, the app detects it, and you can add it to the network. Compare this to the Orbi and its system of pushing sync buttons and routers and satellites, and you’ll see just one example where the Eero outshines Orbi in terms of ease of use.</p><p> Eero Pro and Orbi both support MU-MIMO, and they have similar base ranges, with the Eero Pro router exhibiting a slight edge in range. The Orbi is marketed as an AV2200 device, which theoretically gives it a slight speed advantage based on our calculated AC rating for the Eero Pro.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>This is the mesh router system you want if you’ve never set up a network.</strong></p><p> The Eero Pro is a little on the pricey side, and we were a bit disappointed in the speeds that we measured during testing, but the bottom line is that this system offers decent performance while demystifying the process of setting up a mesh Wi-Fi network. If you want a painless setup process and a system that just works, the Eero Plus is what you’re looking for.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Pro Mesh Wi-Fi System</li><li>Product Brand  Eero</li><li>Price  $399.99</li><li>Weight  0.6 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  4.8 x 4.8 x 1.3 in.</li><li>Speed  1 Gbps (wired), 600 Mbps (Wi-Fi) max rated</li><li>Warranty  One year</li><li>Compatibility  IEEE 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  Yes</li><li>MU-MIMO  Yes</li><li>Number of Antennas  2x2 MU-MIMO w&#x2F;beamforming</li><li>Number of Bands  Tri-band (Eero Pro), dual band (Eero Beacon)</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  1</li><li>Chipset  Atheros IPQ4019</li><li>Range  5,500 sq. ft.

It explains the situation in Harran, the city where the game takes place. The game proper starts with a cut scene that shows you on a plane, about to parachute out. There’s no character creation here, although once you get a little further into the game, you’ll be able to pick your clothes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/P3rXmBBI1GdQfgi0vVT9xKcFw90=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-2-db5990d1f64341eaae79e22a71bb8f95.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship"><a href="#Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship"></a><strong>Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship</strong></h2><p> The initial cutscene starts with you on a plane, preparing to jump. Your name is Kyle Crane, and you’re an undercover operative. You’ll parachute to the earth while your boss explains your mission―to find a stolen file―but the second you hit the ground, things don’t go as planned. You’re attacked and forced to fire your weapon to scatter your attackers. Of course, in zombie-infested Harran, a gunshot is zombie bait. Suddenly they’re swarming toward you and things look very dire, until you’re rescued by a pair of strangers, a man and a woman. The man dies saving you but you and the woman escape. Her name is Jade, and she’ll play a big role throughout the story as you try to win her and her brother’s trust.</p><p>Harran is a whole different city at night.</p><p> You’re a spy sent in to infiltrate this group of survivors by the Global Relief Effort or GRE, but now that they’ve saved your life, you start to feel like you owe them. They’ll send you on missions to prove yourself, such as setting up traps for air raid supply drops or battling the hostile bandits that prowl Harran’s streets. Throughout the game, you balance accomplishing the GRE’s task with serving the best interest of this group of survivors you find yourself increasingly attached to.</p><p> This is a fairly linear game with regards to the plot. There’s a main storyline for you to follow, with some optional side quests that you can take or leave. The narrative does a decent job of building up the circumstances for Kyle feeling torn between his mission and these people, and you’ll learn more about the virus as you go, as well as Antizin, the fictional drug that could lead to a cure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8G35q3VsoSEuht_3bqsGm0Pwz-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-7-d9d2bbe8881e476f8dfb3c13059634ed.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore"><a href="#Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore"></a><strong>Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore</strong></h2><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour. Other zombie games focus on having slow zombies you can run away from, or dumb zombies you sneak past, but Dying Light takes a completely different approach. Instead, the basic zombies are fast and almost always know where you are―but they can’t climb or jump. This means you can stay safe by leaping between rooftops, running up ramps, balancing across bars, etc. The parkour feature is the biggest thing that makes Dying Light unique in an oversaturated genre, and also part of what makes the game so much fun. It’s entertaining to cross the city running as fast as you can without pausing, challenging yourself to get from point A to point B without ever touching the ground.</p><p> If you do happen to find yourself on the ground with a few zombies around you, you’ll have a variety of weapons you can smash a zombies head in with. The game focuses mainly on melee, with occasional firefights with other bandits. The melee weapon system has an upgrade system that involves fusing together found materials. The melee combat is solid, and your swings connect in a satisfying way.</p><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour.</p><p> There are quite a few different types of zombies, and more are introduced the longer you play. There are runners who can parkour right along beside you, frog-men zombies that spit acid, and hulking beasts that swing giant sledgehammers. It’s this variety that keeps the gameplay fun―until night falls.</p><p> Harran is a whole different city at night. If you aren’t in a safe zone, you’ll quickly learn that running through the city at night is terrifying, specifically because of a zombie type called volatiles. Volatiles are crazy strong, super-fast, and will chase after you relentlessly until you get out of sight―not an easy thing to do when you’re freaking out. It can be a real rush to try to do a mission at night, so if things aren’t feeling tense enough for you, just wait until the sunsets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YctEePpYKsIXQ5kU-hQ8w7o9CDo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-4-1edeaf05c6ba435e9b81e68a13831ac6.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> The graphics of Dying Light compare well to other triple-A titles, though it feels like the developers took more care with the scenery than the characters. Human models look a little plasticky, but the world around you is textured beautifully and rich with small details like posters and graffiti that help make the world around you feel real.</p><p> Character animation is also excellent, and the buildings and other objects within the world offer a variety of ways to jump, climb, and crawl. The open urban landscape of Harran allows players to decide how they want to explore, acquire materials, and fight. You’ll be able to come at certain locations from a variety of angles,and it’s this sense of freedom and attention to the environments that brings Dying Light together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sy9NHLj8JNe2eaeS9HJJdejt6QE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-6-56ef808272b544e6a1038f4a5d0280f1.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047346/19272" target="_top" id="2047346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047346/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend"></a><strong>Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend</strong></h2><p> On PlayStation 4, you can purchase the game for $14, a fantastic value. You’ll get more than enough gameplay and fun to justify a purchase at that low cost. However, if you want to play on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll have to either wait for the game to go on sale, or you’ll have to pay $40. Considering the game is older now, we’d suggest getting the game on sale (it goes on sale often through Steam). There’s a lot of fun to be had in Dying Light, especially if you have a friend to play with, so if you’re thinking about getting the game, we’d say go for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130886/7443" target="_top" id="2130886">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130886" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130886/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other zombie and parkour games"></a><strong>Competition: Other zombie and parkour games</strong></h2><p> There are a lot of other zombie survival games out there, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’d recommend them if you liked Dying Light. You might consider Days Gone, another PlayStation 4 zombie apocalypse game set in an open world, but if the parkour was the main attraction, you might look into the game Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. The game follows a girl in a sci-fi world and features first-person parkour running and fighting. Instead of the rough and gritty world of Dying Light, Catalyst takes place in a sleek futuristic dystopia that’s all glossy chrome and burnished glass.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An original in the zombie survival genre.</strong></p><p> Dying Light is a game that took an overdone trope and used it to create a fresh game. Its fun parkour and co-op gameplay make for a great gaming experience, particularly when shared with friends. The variety of zombie enemies combined with the excellent melee combat keep the experience fresh even in the late game―and if things feel too simple, doing a mission at night is a wholly different experience from daylight outings. Dying Light is a great game in the zombie survival genre that we would recommend to most players.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1484963">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484963">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1484963%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484963/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Dying Light</li><li>Price  $14.00</li><li>Available Platforms  PC (Steam) Playstation 4 Xbox One OS X Linux</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ultimate-choice-top-android-3d-players/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Ultimate Choice Top Android 3D Players</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-comprehensively-guide-to-collecting-visual-backgrounds/"><u>[New] Comprehensively Guide to Collecting Visual Backgrounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-getting-started-with-azures-speech-to-text-feature/"><u>[New] Getting Started with Azure's Speech-to-Text Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-dive-deep-with-these-6-extraordinary-metaverse-models-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Dive Deep with These 6 Extraordinary Metaverse Models for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-zoom-review-of-kodak-fz53/"><u>Budget-Friendly Zoom: Review of Kodak FZ53</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/decoding-apples-laptop-lineup-the-differences-between-macbook-air-and-macbook-pro/"><u>Decoding Apple's Laptop Lineup: The Differences Between MacBook Air and MacBook Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-messages-from-samsung-galaxy-a34-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted messages from Samsung Galaxy A34 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-iphone-video-merging-techniques/"><u>In 2024, Mastering iPhone Video Merging Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-viair-88p-compact-air-compressor-balancing-might-and-shortcomings/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of Viair #88P Compact Air Compressor - Balancing Might & Shortcomings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/master-assassin-saga-final-review-is-it-a-flawless-finale/"><u>Master Assassin Saga Final Review: Is It a Flawless Finale?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/revolutionize-interaction-effortless-transfer-of-social-media-storages/"><u>Revolutionize Interaction: Effortless Transfer of Social Media Storages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/status-bt-examination-economical-choice-subpar-perfection/"><u>Status BT Examination: Economical Choice, Subpar Perfection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/top-5-rechargeable-battery-chargers-to-empower-your-laptop-anywhere-202-cuisine/"><u>Top 5 Rechargeable Battery Chargers to Empower Your Laptop Anywhere, 202 Cuisine</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-apple-pay-effortlessly-with-these-10-tips/"><u>Troubleshoot Apple Pay Effortlessly with These 10 Tips</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender takes on a different kind of philosophy. That’s reflected in the boosted price, certainly, but also the capabilities: this is the first Wi-Fi 6 extender on the market.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new standard that not only allows for faster maximum speeds than previous generations but also better accommodates the increasing pile of wireless devices that we have around our homes and connecting at any given time—from phones to laptops and smart home gadgets. Newer smartphones and laptops are implementing support for the standard, and new Wi-Fi routers are being released to supply those benefits.</p><p> If you don’t already have one of those new Wi-Fi 6 routers, should you spend extra for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 to futureproof your setup? Here’s what I think after testing the device for several days across everyday web usage, media streaming, playing online games, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1883998/19272" target="_top" id="1883998">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1883998" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1883998/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Pretty-awkward"><a href="#Design-Pretty-awkward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty awkward"></a><strong>Design: Pretty awkward</strong></h2><p> The Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is not only the largest and heaviest Wi-Fi extender I’ve tested at 10 inches tall and nearly two pounds, but it’s also one of the oddest-looking. It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward. Also, the little plastic feet don’t do a great job of supporting the weight, making it a bit wobbly on a flat surface.</p><p> With very large sides, the front is really just a small panel with light-up LED indicators showing connectivity details and which Ethernet ports are in use. There’s also a small WPS button beneath the LED panel for easy connectivity with a router. On the wider back panel are the four wired<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for plugging in devices such as game consoles and computers, as well as a USB 3.0 port, DC power port, and the power button itself.</p><p> It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135365/19272" target="_top" id="2135365">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135365" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135365/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Avoid the app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Avoid the app</strong></h2><p> The setup options for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 are the same as with Netgear’s other extenders—even those without Wi-Fi 6 support. You’ll begin with the extender plugged in near your router. If your router supports<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you can pair the extender with it easily by following the process listed in the included booklet, which is as simple as pressing a button on the router and then doing the same on the extender.</p><p> If that’s not an option, or you’d rather follow a step-by-step process with prompts, then you can set it up using either a mobile (iOS or Android) app or a web browser on your computer.</p><p> The mobile app has been unreliable in my experience with other Netgear extenders, but it was much worse when setting up the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The app repeatedly could not connect with the created mesh network on the extender during setup, and I had to factory reset the device multiple times to start again.</p><p> Over and over, the setup process wouldn’t complete… and then it finally did. I ran into similar issues with the other Netgear extenders, in which setup processes didn’t work as expected on the first or second time, but this was a much longer and more arduous ordeal. Finally, however, I got the Nighthawk AX8 up and running. From there, you’ll need to find a new location for the extender—roughly halfway between the router and your Wi-Fi dead zone is ideal, but play around with positioning if you’re not getting the results you seek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xru8JLL_UOk3sXBYpbrOyAl-ihc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_02-b120eab8816746338c53e4eb1cfc62d6.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925565/19272" target="_top" id="1925565">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925565" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925565/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Smooth-sailing"><a href="#Connectivity-Smooth-sailing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Smooth sailing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p> Once through the hassle of setup, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender really did deliver strong performance. I tested the connection in my office, which reliably sees reduced 5GHz reception from my router due to obstructions in between, and saw a noticeable boost in both reception and speed.</p><p> In one test, I registered a 5GHz speed of 246Mbps with the extender, which was the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen anywhere in my house using that older, TP-Link router. Given that, I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The router isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, but I still saw higher top-end speeds than ever before.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender also performed pretty well in distance testing. In another instance, I registered a 5GHz download speed of 87Mbps with my office, and then measured the speeds from my backyard at approximate distance intervals from the extender.</p><p> I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8.</p><p> That 5GHz signal dropped down to 77Mbps at 25 feet, 74Mbps at 50 feet, and 56Mbps at 25 feet—still pretty speedy from the farthest edge of my property. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz signal started at just 42Mbps at that moment in my office, and dropped to 30Mbps at 25 feet, 28Mbps at 50 feet, and 26Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Given the high max speeds, it wasn’t surprising to see strong gaming performance, as well. While playing Rocket League, I saw smooth gameplay across the wired Ethernet connection as well as both wireless networks, with a ping as low as 33 via the wired connection. The wireless ping was only a few points higher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rtnI3hSe9qP5qFqjhu1LRxe7qYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_03-19da5fea4d0349ce984f52a11493d337.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> As a Wi-Fi mesh extender, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 will automatically replicate the SSID of your router’s existing Wi-Fi networks and seamlessly keep you connected whenever you’re in range of either. That’s true even with non-Netgear routers and those without Wi-Fi 6 support, and it’s a huge benefit over some cheaper extenders that don’t keep the same network info intact across devices.</p><p> It’s billed as an “8-stream” device, so it should be able to handle several simultaneous media streams at once, with a billed max speed of 4.8Gbps on the 5GHz band and 1.2Gbps on the 2.4GHz band. It has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (multiple users, multi-in multi-out) and beamforming capabilities, promising expanded range of up to 2,500 square feet and support for 30+ simultaneous devices.</p><p> If you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi mesh system instead.</p><h2 id="Price-More-than-most"><a href="#Price-More-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Price: More than most"></a><strong>Price: More than most</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is listed at $250, although it’s being sold for $220 at multiple retailers as of this writing. That’s definitely on the higher end for an extender.</p><p> Should you really spend that much on an extender? If you don’t already have a new Wi-Fi 6 router, then probably not. You might see higher peaks of speed as I did, but rather than trying to mix and match old and new tech, you’re probably better off investing in a new Wi-Fi mesh system that can cover the entire house. Netgear’s Orbi is a favorite, as is Google’s similar Nest Wi-Fi system.</p><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)</strong></h2><p> Both of these Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi extenders will set you back $200 or more, and the key difference between them—aside from design—is the Wi-Fi 6 compatibility of the Nighthawk AX8. The Nighthawk X6S (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Range-Extender-EX8000/dp/B074F3M2W8/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846125%7Cn35b11b2c61b54fa1a2d951691d1a61ed04%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have that, but it does deliver excellent 5GHz range and has four Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices. The Nighthawk AX8 is more future-proof as a result, but at a greater cost that becomes increasingly difficult to justify the higher, it climbs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Only for early adopters with Wi-Fi 6 routers and devices.</strong></p><p> If you’ve already bought a Wi-Fi 6 router and need a little help extending your signal into further corners of your home and&#x2F;or property, then the Nighthawk AX 8 (EAX 80) is the extender you’ll want. But if you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead. Spending more than $200 on an extender doesn’t make much sense unless you’re adding it to a top-of-the-line system—and don’t mind the significant investment.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk EAX80 AX6000 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  EAX80</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  10 x 7.75 x 4.2 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Ports  4x Ethernet, 1x USB</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ow-to-make-a-cool-youtube-video-intro-in-imovie-in-2024/"><u>[New] How to Make a Cool YouTube Video Intro in iMovie, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-top-kid-friendly-drone-models-for-first-flights/"><u>[New] Top Kid-Friendly Drone Models for First Flights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-eight-video-grabber-software/"><u>2024 Approved Top Eight Video Grabber Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-2020-review-apples-arm-powered-pc-blows-the-competition-away/"><u>Apple Mac Mini (M1, 2020) Review: Apple’s ARM-Powered PC Blows The Competition Away</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-alternatives.techidaily.com/cookiebot-fueled-website-optimization-boost-your-online-presence/"><u>Cookiebot-Fueled Website Optimization: Boost Your Online Presence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discovering-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-the-latest-ipad-mini-5-from-apple/"><u>Discovering the Strengths and Weaknesses of the Latest iPad Mini #5 From Apple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/download-epson-workforce-ds30-printer-driver-on-windows-11/"><u>Download Epson WorkForce DS30 Printer Driver on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/elevate-your-systems-audio-capabilities-by-updating-usb-driver-software-in-windows-11107/"><u>Elevate Your System's Audio Capabilities by Updating USB Driver Software in Windows 11/10/7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/how-to-quickly-switch-between-facebook-accounts/"><u>How to Quickly Switch Between Facebook Accounts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/24-unveiling-top-asmr-for-iphone-users/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling Top ASMR for iPhone Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/is-the-microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-worth-it-our-full-assessment-and-value-analysis/"><u>Is The Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard Worth It?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is so cumbersome, unsightly, and complicated that I secretly wanted it to fail. Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049379/7443" target="_top" id="2049379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997630/19272" target="_top" id="1997630">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997630" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997630/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148639/16836" target="_top" id="2148639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148639/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123730/7443" target="_top" id="2123730">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123730" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123730/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-explore-sony-vegas-for-high-impact-video-editing-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Explore Sony Vegas for High-Impact Video Editing on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-internal-device-recorder-to-capture-screens-on-mate-1020-and-p-series-phones-p2010-for-2024/"><u>[New] Internal Device Recorder to Capture Screens on Mate 10/20 & P Series Phones (P20/10) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-layer-audio-onto-video-clips-in-premiere-pro/"><u>[New] Layer Audio Onto Video Clips in Premiere Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/conquer-dead-cells-the-comprehensive-breakdown-of-the-sturdy-beatit-bt-d11-jumpstarter/"><u>Conquer Dead Cells: The Comprehensive Breakdown of the Sturdy Beatit BT-D11 Jumpstarter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/discover-the-15-greatest-free-applications-for-effortless-program-removal/"><u>Discover the 15 Greatest Free Applications for Effortless Program Removal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/essential-buyers-guide-to-the-budget-friendly-amazon-kindle-of-2019/"><u>Essential Buyer's Guide to the Budget-Friendly Amazon Kindle of 2019</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/experience-the-beast-detailed-examination-of-the-giant-amongst-galaxys-remote-control-trucks-the-ford-f-150-edition/"><u>Experience the Beast: Detailed Examination of the Giant Amongst Galaxy's Remote Control Trucks - The Ford F-150 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/highly-rated-philips-somneo-analysis-leading-alarm-clocks-unveiled/"><u>Highly Rated Philips Somneo Analysis: Leading Alarm Clocks Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-realme-12-proplus-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-google-nest-mini-camera-exploring-facial-recognition-and-innovative-delivery-notifications/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Google Nest Mini Camera: Exploring Facial Recognition & Innovative Delivery Notifications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/intuitive-action-capture-in-depth-analysis-of-the-budget-friendly-z-edge-z3-plus/"><u>Intuitive Action Capture: In-Depth Analysis of the Budget-Friendly Z-Edge Z3 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/is-your-iphone-6s-plus-in-security-lockout-proper-ways-to-unlock-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Is Your iPhone 6s Plus in Security Lockout?

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety.

Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997648/19272" target="_top" id="1997648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997648/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424528">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424528">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424528%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424528/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135414/19272" target="_top" id="2135414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135414/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C302 Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  TopMate</li><li>MPN  C302</li><li>Price  $30.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2016</li><li>Weight  1.09 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.2 x 10.43 x 1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Ports  USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-igtv-content-editing-titles-and-descriptions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhancing IGTV Content Editing Titles & Descriptions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-winter-wonderland-in-beijing-olympic-year-2022/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Winter Wonderland in Beijing, Olympic Year 2022</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-quickly-change-digital-pictures-darkness-level/"><u>[Updated] Quickly Change Digital Pictures' Darkness Level</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/blending-realms-a-guide-to-photomosaic-creation/"><u>Blending Realms A Guide to PhotoMosaic Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/craft-humor-for-giphy-network-for-2024/"><u>Craft Humor for Giphy Network for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/easy-guide-to-honor-90-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-by-drfone-android/"><u>Easy Guide to Honor 90 FRP Bypass With Best Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-screen-mirroring-motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Screen Mirroring Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023)?

This promises to be one of the most expansive and unique games in a long line of genre-defining titles with an enormous open world map and a wealth of engaging stories and activities to participate in. Valhalla builds on many of the mechanics players first saw in Assassins’s Creed: Origins and Odyssey, containing more RPG elements, a variety of combat styles, and plenty of upgrades.</p><p> I played the game on PC for several days, but it’s also available on all other major platforms including the upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/price-release-date-specs-xbox-series-x-5077092" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Xbox One, upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-4778089" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and PlayStation 4.</p><h2 id="Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled"><a href="#Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled" class="headerlink" title="Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled"></a><strong>Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled</strong></h2><p> There’s a lot to say here, but not much that can be said without spoilers. Given how engaging I found the plot, it would be a shame to spoil it in any way. Suffice it to say that, though it begins as a typical revenge story, it soon becomes more complex and interesting. You play as Eivor, a male or female warrior who raids England during the reign of Alfred the Great.</p><p> Aside from the basis in history, there are fascinating mythological elements to the storyline, and obviously, much attention was paid to crafting an authentic recreation of the cultures being represented here. The game does a good job of focusing on telling a story about Vikings, while also working the series namesake “Assassins” into the mix in a plausible manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pWujlWPf0ylYYpeoTEbp7X8U0yM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-4-07677871281c40a384f2df55f83e86a4.jpg"                      alt="AC Vallhalla 2"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Perhaps more interesting than the main plot are the side quests sprinkled liberally about the world. These are typically informal, chance encounters and, though they do grant experience towards skill points, their primary point is to tell an intriguing story, which they accomplish with aplomb. The characters are almost invariably well-acted, and while short, these quests are remarkably well written and worth seeking out.</p><p> The prologue map alone in Norway covers 15 square kilometers, and has between 10 and 15 hours worth of gameplay. It honestly is worth the cost of admission in its own right. I could easily have spent 20 hours there just climbing mountains. However, the core of the game is set in England, and the map is absolutely gigantic.</p><p> In total, the game’s various open world areas cover a staggering 140 square kilometers, nearly ten times the size of the prologue area. By this rough estimate, there should be at least 120 hours worth of content in this game, including a roughly 60-hour main campaign. Missions, mysteries, and treasure in abundance ensure that the wilderness never grows stale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vk4XvoE4lJwcjde1C_tJUVBc0Ac=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-9-a5e8ef2a5bef455d8cbaa9e749167f53.jpg"                      alt="AC sneak"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983573">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983573">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983573%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983573/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master"><a href="#Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master"></a><strong>Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master</strong></h2><p> Valhalla’s gameplay will be familiar to fans of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, particularly the more recent entries in the series. As usual, there are tweaks and innovations, but it was easy enough for me to pick up, with my most recent experience being with AC Unity. Players who’ve played Origins and Odyssey will find much to be familiar. The fluid movement and iconic parkour makes navigating around the expansive open world fun and engaging, though novices may accidentally fling themselves off a cliff or two by accident as they learn the ropes.</p><p> Fall damage is back, but don’t worry though, most falls won’t kill you, and you can just scarf a few berries and be right as rain. It’s worth the risk, as climbing mountains is in itself an activity that offers hours of freeform fun. As is traditional for Assassin’s Creed games, you can safely leap from any high place so long as there is a pile of hay, leaves, or a shallow pond to break your fall.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells.</p><p> There are traditional observation points to unlock, but there are also plenty of interesting peaks, spires, and mountain tops with unique views to discover. Most aren’t marked, so there’s a sense of discovery in seeking them out, and thanks to a robust photo mode, it’s fun to document your hiking and climbing adventures.</p><p> Traveling long distances around the map can be done via unlockable fast travel locations, but the vast, beautiful world crafted for Valhalla encouraged me to explore it on foot, even for paths I had trodden more than once. This is aided by your ability to summon a horse or a longboat to your position, either of which is an exciting way to travel.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells. Alternatively, your bard may accompany your seafaring with diverting tales. If there’s one downside is that unlike Odyssey, there’s no ship-to-ship naval combat, but perhaps that makes sense because the Vikings were more land raiders despite their extensive use of longboats to travel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/giaP-JV9QK6uFcdU_di4iWkvszw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-5-56a01de51a2a4540ae8650bece502873.jpg"                      alt="AC Valhalla 3"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Combat is fast, brutal, and varied with deep customization and different potential approaches. There are many ways to approach each situation, and none of them are wrong. You can sneak in and pick the enemy off one by one, dumping their carcasses in bushes so as not to tip off their friends, or you can nail them from a distance with arrows. Alternatively, you can stride in, axes twirling, and cut a bloody swath through your foes.</p><p> Skill points are given to you as you level up and can be used to upgrade your character and hone their skill in ranged, stealth, or melee fields. Abilities can also be discovered by reading books hidden throughout the world. This is the main way you can specialize your character build. If you want a more traditional assassin experience, put all your points into stealth or ranged, but if you want to live your life as a brutal Viking warlord, go all-in on melee. My favorite move is one in which you hurl throwing axes all around you in slow motion.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side. Even better are raids, where you leap from your ship among a horde of screaming Vikings to slay your enemies and loot their towns.</p><p> Raiding becomes a vital component of the game, as raids are the only way to build your settlement. It’s not a particularly complex base building mechanic, as it only involves raiding the requisite supplies and returning them to your settlement, whereupon a new building magically appears. It’s fun to watch your settlement grow, and you gradually unlock a variety of different functions and quests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/n9S5L4JClTiqP1vYa_7cTGw6o0c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-7-d89d4a9941b8488ea6ef1aeba6486895.jpg"                      alt="AC ship"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484945/16446" target="_top" id="1484945">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484945" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484945/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080312/19272" target="_top" id="2080312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080312/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize"><a href="#Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize" class="headerlink" title="Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize"></a><strong>Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize</strong></h2><p> Valhalla gives you plenty of ways to customize your experience. You can adjust the difficulty of stealth, combat, and exploration separately, so you can choose which gameplay elements are difficult and which you’d rather not get in the way. Additionally, mature elements in the game such as blood and gore can be toggled on and off, which will be a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-pc-games-4147292" >relief to parents <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a boon to anyone who doesn’t fancy seeing severed heads flying through the air.</p><h2 id="Minigames-Enjoyable-diversions"><a href="#Minigames-Enjoyable-diversions" class="headerlink" title="Minigames: Enjoyable diversions"></a><strong>Minigames: Enjoyable diversions</strong></h2><p> There’s more to do than fighting and exploring; in Valhalla there are a number of intriguing minigames to divert you from quests. I particularly enjoyed Flyting, which is a battle of words These are timed, competitive poetry contests where you must quickly select the most appropriate verse from a list of options. It’s both amusing and character building.</p><p> Orlog is an interesting dice game that I would honestly like to own in real life, and the drinking minigame is a highly enjoyable reflex-based challenge. A nice touch is that the results of imbibing huge amounts of mead persist for a period of time after the minigame is complete. After all, are you really a Viking warrior if you’re not completely drunk all the time?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/trRirIDsjFej03o-_HDCFsnnrzs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-6-5449cde060b441a499a5189fda9a7a0a.jpg"                      alt="AC tattoos"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak"><a href="#Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak" class="headerlink" title="Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak"></a><strong>Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak</strong></h2><p> As in Odyssey, the game allows you to play as either male or female, and offers a range of cosmetic options, mainly by way of tattoos and hairstyles. New tattoo patterns are acquired through parkour challenges. What’s more interesting is the gameplay affecting clothing and weapons that alter your appearance—I particularly appreciated that upgrading those items affects their looks. You can choose from different ravens and horses, and change the appearance of your longship. Eventually, you will also be able to customize the appearance of your settlement.</p><p> I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Epic-good-looks"><a href="#Graphics-Epic-good-looks" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Epic good looks"></a><strong>Graphics: Epic good looks</strong></h2><p> Valhalla is an absolutely gorgeous game. Everything from the detailed character models to the vibrant open world is beautiful to look upon. Changing weather alters the mood of landscapes, and can create breathtaking moments. I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><p> Towns and cities are richly detailed, with people going about their daily business in this muddy and gritty medieval setting. The wilderness is also magnificent, with wild natural beauty and towering ruins in equal measure.

I initially installed it on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, which I reviewed recently and found to be capable of running modern titles at high or max settings. However, Valhalla appears to be a whole different kind of beast and played havoc on my machine.</p><p> When I first jumped into the game after the intro cutscene, I was greeted with the most horrendous graphics glitching I’ve ever experienced. Thinking this was because I had foolishly maxed the settings I restarted after tweaking down graphics, but upon restart, the glitches were appearing in the menu itself. I exited the game and the glitches persisted for about 10 seconds after Valhalla had closed. The built-in benchmarking tool in the game refused to run entirely. In the end, I decided not to push my luck with the laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R1pb8_CqlpJqAmK9Ka9-pgyOyJk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-3-ea07cee8afaa4cc89c4e2bb286b894a0.jpg"                      alt="AC ruins"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886048/19272" target="_top" id="1886048">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886048" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886048/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> On a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-pcs-4045451" >gaming PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a more powerful processor, more RAM, and an RTX 2070<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-graphics-cards-4692676" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , I didn’t encounter any glitches. However, the game is extremely power-hungry, and I was only able to run it at max settings with 60fps at 1080p. Ubisoft titles are known for being poorly optimized at launch, so this game should perform better after a few patches. Still, it’s clearly designed for next-gen consoles and the latest PC hardware. If you are playing on PC, be sure to utilize the benchmarking tool to find the ideal settings for your system.</p><p> Of course, if you’re playing on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you don’t have to worry about performance issues since the game is better optimized. It’s currently available for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and will be available for the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 at launch. You can also get it on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-stadia-review-4788032" >Google Stadia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Price-Typical-AAA"><a href="#Price-Typical-AAA" class="headerlink" title="Price: Typical AAA"></a><strong>Price: Typical AAA</strong></h2><p> The base game will set you back the typical $60, while the gold edition bundles in the season pass and costs a full $100. That will include the planned expansions which will add Ireland and France to the map. Expensive though $100 is, it does promise a potentially huge amount of content. The game also has microtransactions, which is a bit of a bummer, though these weren’t integrated into the game at the time of writing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/teY5MG-6xAT5sxNurIFy_iYPPvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-2-58ab82ef1f624e01b1c1c6dab8bca06b.jpg"                      alt="AC horse"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030129/11832" target="_top" id="1030129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030129/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion"><a href="#Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion" class="headerlink" title="Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion"></a><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion</strong></h2><p> It’s interesting that Ubisoft decided to launch two third-person action games set in England within a span of a few weeks. Where Valhalla is set in the Middle Ages,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-new-setting-for-the-series-5085469" >Watch Dogs: Legion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is set in a near-future sci-fi dystopia, though in both games you are battling against tyrannical rulers in England. Choose Watch Dogs if you want sci-fi focused on hackers and non-violent solutions, and Valhalla if you love bloody medieval fighting and exploration.</p><p> It’s also worth mentioning the resemblance between Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla to The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. The comparison is inescapable due to the fact that both are based on Norse culture. While Valhalla is certainly a more historically grounded game as opposed to Skyrim’s totally fictional fantasy realm, Valhalla will nonetheless be familiar and exciting for fans of Skyrim.</p><p> Final Verdict: Epic stories and exciting combat in a sprawling open world.</p><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla exceeds, as Assassin’s Creed games so often do, in creating the most painstakingly detailed virtual recreation of a place and period possible. It’s got exploration, intense combat, and enthralling stories by the bucket full, and it’s easy to get lost in its sheer scope and scale. Just beware if you’re playing on a PC that will test the limits of your gaming rig.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (PC)</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Platforms  PC, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Stadia</li><li>Rating  M</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-10-free-and-paid-luts-for-canon-camera/"><u>[New] 10 Free & Paid LUTs for Canon Camera</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-achieving-perfect-picture-quality-on-zoom/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Achieving Perfect Picture Quality on Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/easy-guide-how-to-download-the-newest-canon-mg-series-drivers-for-flawless-printing/"><u>Easy Guide: How to Download the Newest Canon MG Series Drivers for Flawless Printing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-catch-100-iv-pokemon-using-a-map-on-htc-u23-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Full Guide to Catch 100 IV Pokémon Using a Map On HTC U23 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-crafting-impact-the-quintessential-five-youtube-marketing-approaches/"><u>In 2024, Crafting Impact The Quintessential Five YouTube Marketing Approaches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-vivo-s17-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Vivo S17 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-integrating-subtitles-into-your-online-social-videography-efforts/"><u>In 2024, Integrating Subtitles Into Your Online Social Videography Efforts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/support-locked-blizzard-disconnected/"><u>Support Locked: Blizzard Disconnected</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/uncharted-waters-of-assassins-creed-valhalla-a-detailed-review-of-the-epic-nordic-quest/"><u>Uncharted Waters of Assassin's Creed: Valhalla - A Detailed Review of the Epic Nordic Quest</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unleashing-powerhouse-performance-a-comprehensive-review-of-the-xbox-series-x-delivering-stunning-4k-gaming/"><u>Unleashing Powerhouse Performance: A Comprehensive Review of the Xbox Series X Delivering Stunning 4K Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unleashing-productivity-potential-the-apple-ipad-7th-gen-review-focused-on-the-transformative-power-of-ipados/"><u>Unleashing Productivity Potential: The Apple iPad (7Th Gen) Review Focused on the Transformative Power of IPadOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-potential-of-asus-rog-gt-ac5300-why-its-perfect-for-gamers-and-tech-enthusiasts/"><u>Unveiling the Potential of Asus ROG GT-AC5300: Why It's Perfect for Gamers and Tech Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-powerful-features-of-the-rca-video-doorbell-camera/"><u>Unveiling the Powerful Features of the RCA Video Doorbell Camera</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-powerful-performance-a-detailed-review-of-the-fujitsu-scansnap-ix1600-desk-top-document-screener/"><u>Unveiling the Powerful Performance: A Detailed Review of the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1600 Desk-Top Document Screener</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-refined-features-and-streamlined-appeal-of-the-samsung-galaxy-s21/"><u>Unveiling the Refined Features and Streamlined Appeal of the Samsung Galaxy S21</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The antenna comes with a strip of adhesive that can be used to affix it directly to a wall or other preferred surface.</p><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna had the best results of any unpowered antenna, even beating out a few of the powered ones.</p><p> Luckily the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna comes with a 12ft coaxial cable, so next simply attach the cable to both the antenna and your TV. Make sure to run a channel scan first for best results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135365/19272" target="_top" id="2135365">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135365" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135365/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Above-average"><a href="#Performance-Above-average" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Above average"></a><strong>Performance: Above average</strong></h2><p> I’ve tested a lot of similar antennas recently, and the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna had the best results of any unpowered antenna, even beating out a few of the powered ones. From my apartment, I was able to get acquire an average of 65 channels across all my tests. For reference, the worst-performing antenna found just 47, and the best, 76.</p><h2 id="Range-Fair-to-middling"><a href="#Range-Fair-to-middling" class="headerlink" title="Range: Fair to middling"></a><strong>Range: Fair to middling</strong></h2><p> Antenna’s Direct rates the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna for up to 35 miles of range, although I’ve seen reports of people getting good results from further, or having trouble from much closer. My apartment is well within the supported range, so my sentiments reflect its use in city settings more than suburbs or exurbs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/i57THpEHitQ6h-N5c-bgGLEHwJs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_Eclipse_04-6ea1dbbe93374539876c7e76dcebb18e.jpg"                      alt="ClearStream Eclipse Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528696/16446" target="_top" id="1528696">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528696" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528696/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad-for-the-performance"><a href="#Price-Not-bad-for-the-performance" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad for the performance"></a><strong>Price: Not bad for the performance</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna lands at an MSRP of $40, putting it towards the high end of the price spectrum, especially where non-powered antennas are concerned. It did do one of the best jobs of supporting as many channels as possible, so the price is somewhat justified. Then again, every single one of the indoor antennas I’ve tested was able to handle the major network channels clearly and without issue, so a high channel number might not mean more than peace of mind in practical terms.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-Eclipse-Antenna-vs-Winegard-FL5500A-FlatWave-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-Eclipse-Antenna-vs-Winegard-FL5500A-FlatWave-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream Eclipse Antenna vs Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream Eclipse Antenna vs Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna</strong></h2><p> If my testing is any indication of broader performance, there is really no reason to get the Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna instead of the ClearStream Eclipse. The Eclipse is over $10 cheaper ($40 vs $52), and managed to support 8 more channels on average. To add insult to injury, the Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna is amplified using a USB power adapter, which adds a bit of clutter and complication to the overall setup.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best unpowered indoor antenna.</strong></p><p> The ClearStream Eclipse is one of the best options for buyers looking for a new indoor antenna. It performed better than a lot of the competition, despite being far simpler. Budget shoppers have other cheaper options to consider, but this one is perhaps the best combination of price, performance, and ease-of-use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938141">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938141">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938141%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938141/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  ECLIPSE</li><li>Product Brand  Clearstream</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Release Date  June 2016</li><li>Weight  4 oz.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-selecting-the-best-mac-sniping-solutions/"><u>[New] Selecting the Best Mac Sniping Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-novices-map-to-snapseed-photoshop-wonders/"><u>[New] The Novice's Map to Snapseed Photoshop Wonders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-reverse-films-on-android/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Reverse Films on Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/app-wont-open-on-your-honor-x50-here-are-all-fixes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>App Wont Open on Your Honor X50?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The original Xbox One controller has undergone quite a few changes and iterations over the console’s long life. You’ve got the original version that launched with the Xbox One, a slightly updated version of that, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-s-controller-review-4770950" >One S controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and then the Elite. Each of these controllers were pretty well-received in their day, but Microsoft carefully improved and updated them throughout the years to make them even better.</p><p> We reviewed the original $150 Elite controller when it debuted years ago and loved nearly every aspect of it, but it wasn’t flawless suffering from the lack of a few key features and some durability issues. This is where the newly updated Elite Series 2 controller comes in. Listening to feedback provided by gamers on the weaknesses of Series 1, Microsoft has put out what is likely to be the last iteration of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-consoles-4156250" >Xbox One controller, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it’s pretty much perfect—provided you’re willing to pay the hefty price tag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/t8wI_yN2s_uIQ1leo87MmOnXxb4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-5-0c39ec4e89eb45b094471681efec0e7d.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed"><a href="#Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed" class="headerlink" title="Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed"></a><strong>Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed</strong></h2><p> The general format of the Elite Series 2 takes the basic XB1 controller and builds upon that excellent design by adding in tons of extras and features. However, unlike the first Elite controller, this version uses the newer One S model controller as its basis. This means there is no more two-piece design where the top and bottom shells of the controller are separate. The build is less flashy perhaps, no longer sporting a two-tone finish, but it makes it feel much more solid and creates a sleeker look.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout. The original Elite used brushed aluminum as an accent tone, but that’s been swapped for a darker gunmetal finish that I personally love. This accent tone is found along the top bumpers and triggers (that are now textured plastic), as well as the analog sticks and Xbox&#x2F;home button. You’ll also notice that the mini<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the top is now USB Type-C. Aside from my personal dream of this USB port becoming the universal design for all electronics, this implementation offers a superior port with better data transfer speeds and quicker charging times, so it’s nice to see here.</p><p> The grips this time have been heavily revamped (a welcome change as they were a point of weakness for durability on the Series 1), wrapping around the back, sides, and front for a seamless texture. Also changed from the previous Elite, these grips are no longer grey, but instead a nice black tone to match the rest of this black beauty.</p><p> For the face of the Series 2, the four iconic Xbox buttons are unchanged, but there are a few small changes elsewhere. The toggle switch from the Series 1 has now been swapped for a simple push-button that allows you to toggle between premade profiles with even more flexibility. It is easier to accidentally push, but we didn’t find it to be an issue.</p><p> One of the most striking changes to this area is the D-pad, which no longer sticks out from the design with its shiny aluminum surface. This time around, it’s sporting a flat black color that meshes much better with the overall look of the Series 2. It’s still got the radar-dish design that I personally find to be one of the best D-pad designs for any controller ever made.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout.</p><p> The rear of the Series 2 is slightly different from its predecessor, mainly the lack of a removable battery. Now this change is a bit polarizing for two main reasons. A rechargeable battery is super convenient since you can simply plug it in and juice it up, never having to worry about scrambling around for new batteries. On the other hand, this battery, like all rechargeable batteries, will ultimately wear down and eventually need replacing, which you can no longer do on your own. Much like smartphones that have ditched removable batteries, it seems like more and more devices are forgoing that option. We personally love the rechargeable pack included and supposedly it’ll last 10 years, but when it does get worn out, your only option is to send it in to have Microsoft replace it.</p><p> There is also a minimal charging strip where the battery sits, allowing you to use the included dock plugged into your USB-C cord to charge the controller when not in use. This dock is an excellent perk of the Series 2, negating the need for third-party docks that are often plagued with issues. I found it convenient to leave this dock plugged into the Xbox all the time so that I could place the controller there for a quick charge between gaming sessions or at the end of the night.</p><p> Battery aside, the rear of the Series 2 also features the optional paddles and extra buttons if you like to use those for added customization. The only difference with these is the finish, which now matches the dark tone of the D-pad. Lastly, the hair triggers return, but now have three different settings instead of two, providing even more potential customizing.</p><p> The final part of the design we’d like to discuss is the case. The first Elite also included a case, but this too has been refreshed for the Series 2. The first thing of note is that it isn’t quite the same case just rehashed. Close inspection shows that the material has also been changed a bit, making it smoother and less scratchy. The zipper also uses the new gunmetal finish. One of the more important changes to the case is that the top now includes a port for the charging dock, so you can even charge your controller right inside the case.</p><p> Inside the case, the material has also been swapped from grey to black to continue the darker theme of the Series 2. You’ll also notice the foam pad is no longer here, as that’s where the dock sits. This dock can be removed or used inside the case and attaches with a strong magnet. The last two parts of the case are unchanged from Series 1, with a mesh cradle for accessories on the top and a foam organizer to hold all the swappable thumbsticks and paddles when not in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TRrezKVbAUPs2Rud3g4_iOHyxB8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-2-4b3f9d8acd1440089989378253d902f4.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy"><a href="#Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy"></a><strong>Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy</strong></h2><p> The original Elite was perhaps the most comfortable controller I’ve ever used, so with the Series 2, I had high hopes in this department. Thanks to some clever but subtle changes by the Microsoft team, this controller is even better.</p><p> The main points of ergonomic superiority the Elite has over the cheaper XB1 controllers stem from the finish, grips and sheer customization that allows each user to tailor their controller to their preference. With so many options between different combinations of thumbsticks, D-pads, and paddles, everyone can find their optimal setup after some experimenting.</p><p> The grips are perhaps the most important part of this realm since that’s where your hands will be in contact with the controller most of the time. Luckily, they’re even better on the Series 2. While the original Elite only had rubberized grips along the back, the Series 2 has them wrapped around the full circumference of the device. This means your hands rest on them completely, providing a nice grippy surface that never gets slippery.</p><p> The last point of comfort I appreciated on the Series 2 is the textured triggers. While somewhat gimmicky, I found it to be better suited for quickly identifying between the triggers and bumpers, similar to how the home row on your keyboard has bumps on it.</p><p> The only real issue some users may see as a downside of this controller is that it’s quite a hefty device. The controller weighs 348 grams with all attachments, so it might take some getting used to compared to the 210 gram S controller. I personally love the bulk, as it feels premium, but it might not be for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cS5fpyPSlqvyETs-nGxTtAB3vXU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-4-070b6c59b206457ba1068704bbe7bca9.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last"></a><strong>Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last</strong></h2><p> One of our biggest gripes with the original Elite controller was that it lacked Bluetooth functionality despite its premium price tag. Seeing how the much cheaper ONE S variant included this, it was even more frustrating. Thankfully, Microsoft listened to our collective rants and added Bluetooth to the Series 2, which drastically improves the number of devices it can be used with.</p><p> The overall setup process for the new Series 2 is quick and simple (more so than the first Elite). So let’s cover how to use it with both your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and PC. First things first, make sure the rechargeable battery is sufficiently charged (it comes charged out of the box) and you’re ready to pair it with the console.</p><p> To do so, turn on your console first and wait for it to fully boot. Now power on the controller and hold down the pairing button on the top until the Xbox symbol flashes. Then do the same thing on your console’s pairing button until both begin to rapidly flash (this indicates they are searching for each other). Once paired, the flashing will slow and then stop completely to show they have successfully paired.</p><p> As we stated earlier, the inclusion of Bluetooth means using the Series 2 with your PC is even easier than previous<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/games-console-reviews-4102640" >Xbox One controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For those who plan to use their Elite Series 2 with a PC, this is perhaps the single best upgrade over the Series 1, because you no longer need the annoyingly large adapter to pair it with your PC (also saving you an additional $25).</p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC.</p><p> To do this, first ensure your PC is running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and your controller is also updated. Next, you can turn on the controller and head to the computer. At your desktop, select Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices, then turn Bluetooth on so it can discover the controller. After doing so, you should see “Xbox Wireless Controller” pop up, and you can now click “pair” from there and you’re ready to game.</p><p> For those who want to use their PC for local multiplayer games, it should also be noted that you can only connect one Bluetooth controller to your PC at a time. In addition to that limitation, you also can’t use any attachments like headsets, chat pads or the stereo adapter in this mode.</p><p> If you plan to buy this controller to use with other electronics that support Bluetooth devices, make sure you do some research before committing to it, as it doesn’t always work with everything. That said, we did manage to pair the controller with a couple other devices that weren’t officially supported.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v25KBj3XhkgWMjFaqVnLVUUJqSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-3-29dc70adabc64f888db60e817695153f.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982596">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982596">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982596%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982596/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability"><a href="#Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability" class="headerlink" title="Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability"></a><strong>Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability</strong></h2><p> To test the performance of the new Elite Series 2 controller, I put this device through several hours of gaming on both PC and Xbox One platforms running a number of games and layouts. The results were promising, so let’s take a closer look.</p><p> Enhanced performance in games is one of the big selling points of the Elite, which is marketed towards players who want to gain an advantage over those with regular controllers. While subtle, I did feel that the Elite improved some small aspects of my gameplay, though skill trumps this in every way.</p><p> For things like shooters, the hair triggers will give you a slight increase to reaction time, as there is less pull, but it takes some getting used to. The longer thumbsticks supposedly help with things like aim time, but getting used to them requires a bit of relearning to get the muscle memory rewired. Personally, I prefer the shorter sticks, but to each their own.</p><p> The paddles are great for adding additional functionality to your controller that non-Elite controllers can’t touch. For racing games like Forza, using these to shift gears means you can do so without having to move your fingers from other buttons. However, because these are unique to the Elite controllers, new users will have a steep learning curve to successfully implement them into their gameplay.</p><p> This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console.</p><p> The enhanced D-pad is perhaps my favorite piece of kit to instantly improve gaming performance. For things like platformers or fighting games, the dish design is exceptionally good at helping you to nail combos or tricky movements, and I always have it equipped.</p><p> No matter what games we used the Series 2 with, from Destiny 2 to Dragon Ball Fighter Z and more, we felt the controller added a subtle but noticeable boost to performance over a regular controller. That being said, it won’t drastically make you better, so don’t get your hopes up.</p><p> In terms of durability, this new Series 2 addresses several weaknesses of the Series 1. The rubber grips used to be a particularly weak point, coming unglued from the body over time. It seems like Microsoft have fixed this, but only time will tell.</p><p> The bumpers on every XB1 controller up until the One S were another point of failure due to the thin plastic piece that attached them to the controller. If you dropped your controller in just the right spot, even from a short height, they often broke and flopped around, requiring you to either send it in for repair or fix it yourself at home. The original Elite also suffered from this, and I experienced this with my first device. Now that the Series 2 is built off the S controller, this is supposedly no longer an issue.</p><p> While we didn’t experience any durability issues with our controller, the long-term durability will need to be assessed at a later date, though it seems to have gotten some upgrades to resolve issues of the past.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console"><a href="#Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console" class="headerlink" title="Price: Like buying a brand new console"></a><strong>Price: Like buying a brand new console</strong></h2><p> Right now, the Elite Series 2 controller retails at an MSRP of $249.99, about $100 more than its predecessor. This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console (or three brand new titles). That can be a tough sell for your average gamer.</p><p> Sure, all of the included extras, customization potential, and the ultra-premium feel is nice, but does that warrant the cost? Well, that’s for you to decide ultimately, but if you do plan on fully utilizing the customization potential, it’s probably worth it. Otherwise, the One S is probably sufficient.</p><p> The argument could be made that considering you get a Bluetooth controller capable of working on XB1 and PC, a charging dock and a nice little case to keep it all together, the cost isn’t awful. But if you want all of those things for less, you can grab an S controller, dock and case for far, far less.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6VfCJGOyjLkAkE_mjiHr7rz8Gyw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-6-0c1d7a2ae4e8443ea5b69f559e52bd12.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049390/7443" target="_top" id="2049390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller"><a href="#Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller"></a><strong>Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller</strong></h2><p> Since the Elite controller really is in a league of its own, the biggest competitor to it is the first generation, which can still be purchased from a number of retailers. We’re going to quickly compare the two to see which might be best for you.</p><p> So we’ve covered a lot of the differences between the two series throughout this article, and while the second iteration is much improved over the first, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-elite-controller-review-4770957" >original Elite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is still a perfectly capable controller with most of the same features. Now that the new one is out, the older model has also dropped a bit in price—making it more appealing. The price of the Series 1 can vary wildly from as little as $100 all the way up to the original tag of $150 depending on where you look, but saving up to $80 for a controller with mostly the same features is an excellent way to get into the Elite series for less.</p><p> Cost aside, there are a few key things you’ll lose if you go with the first model. Perhaps the most noteworthy advantage the Series 2 has is Bluetooth connectivity. This key feature means you no longer need the obtrusive USB wireless adapter to use it with a PC, and it’ll also work with more devices. The other major advantage is the durability improvements on the second iteration, which should make it last even longer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A truly awesome controller with a steep price point.</strong></p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC. However, the steep price point might be a hard pill to swallow for users who don’t like to splurge.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>MPN  400063527030</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Weight  2.89 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.6 x 3.6 x 7.6 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Type  Elite</li><li>Wired&#x2F;Wireless  Wireless</li><li>Removable Cable  Yes</li><li>Battery life  ~40 hours</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;outputs  USB Type-C, 3.5mm jack, Xbox data port</li><li>Warranty  90-day warranty</li><li>Compatibility  All Xbox One Consoles, Windows 10 PCs, Bluetooth devices</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-mastering-zooms-video-enhancements-filter-techniques/"><u>[New] Mastering Zoom's Video Enhancements Filter Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-safely-archive-chats-and-calls-from-whatsapp-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Safely Archive Chats and Calls From WhatsApp for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-drone-shoppers-guide-crucial-factors-and-insights/"><u>2024 Approved Essential Drone Shopper's Guide Crucial Factors & Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-save-time-money-on-passport-photos-with-our-free-generator-apps/"><u>2024 Approved Save Time, Money on Passport Photos with Our Free Generator Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/ace-your-shoots-with-the-top-ranking-dji-mavic-2-pro-examined-by-experts/"><u>Ace Your Shoots with the Top-Ranking DJI Mavic 2 Pro Examined by Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/apple-enthusiasts-rejoice-the-ultimate-freestyle2-blue-mac-app-review/"><u>Apple Enthusiasts Rejoice: The Ultimate Freestyle2 Blue Mac App Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/b550-xt-explored-masterful-voice-interaction-sound-shields/"><u>B550-XT Explored: Masterful Voice Interaction, Sound Shields</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/best-of-the-best-elite-uninterruptible-power-supplies-to-shield-your-tech/"><u>Best of the Best: Elite Uninterruptible Power Supplies to Shield Your Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/best-substitutes-for-ms-office-the-2024-edition/"><u>Best Substitutes for MS Office: The 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/bouncie-driving-connected-review-a-simple-and-affordable-gps-tracker/"><u>Bouncie Driving Connected Review: A Simple and Affordable GPS Tracker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/budget-android-champion-delving-into-the-samsung-galaxy-a20s-performance-and-features/"><u>Budget Android Champion?
