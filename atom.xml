While I’ve built up great cities on earth, there is one place I haven’t been to: outer space. Surviving Mars fills this planet-sized hole.</p><p> Released in 2018, the Surviving Mars developed by Haemimont Games and published by Paradox Interactive poses a massive challenge: colonizing a planet. When I picked this up, I decided to check out how the game fared for a two-year-old game in terms of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/graphic-design-basics-s2-1074288" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , gameplay, and competition. Read on for the verdict to see how it measures up against other games on our best city-building games list—and for forewarning about those pesky cold waves.</p><h2 id="Plot-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Plot-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Lots of options"></a><strong>Plot: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> For a city-building game, Surviving Mars offers a plethora of gaming options once you move past the tutorial. For example, when starting a game, you can choose who funds the colony, ranging from a United Space Federation to China to the United States. Each comes with its own perks and drawbacks, and creates new challenges for each scenario. You can also set more harsh conditions to create more fun<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/produce-videogame-videos-for-youtube-3562561" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as pick an area of land less suitable for human habitation.</p><p> As for a real plotline, there isn’t really one—the only kind of plot in the game is the objective to colonize Mars. There are challenges which you can do if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, which is nice, but they’re not a real plotline, and only serve to give you a different angle to colonizing the planet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tWjPu4rcPDZ30Ilhru3tUFnqjc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_02-d1d5dfcccecb478098ab06a6b5137e68.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying"><a href="#Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Humans have never been so annoying"></a><strong>Performance: Humans have never been so annoying</strong></h2><p> The game begins with a multi-hour long tutorial program, which I highly recommend you undertake before playing the game. There are so many various aspects to the game—basic needs, threats to your colony, resources to import and export—that it would be disastrous not to get caught up to speed. It took me a total of five hours to complete these tutorials, but I had to restart a couple after a couple operator error moments when I accidentally destroyed my only water vaporizer and had no idea how to rebuild it. So, it will probably take you less.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony. You can build in a more stable area of the planet, at the cost of valuable resources like water and metals. Alternately, if you prefer to throw caution to the Mars winds, you can settle for a more resource-rich area. However, when I mention those Mars winds, I really mean it. In the midst of building your colony, you’ll have to beware the dangers of dust storms. Normally, I would brush these dangers aside in a video game. After experiencing them, however, they’re catastrophic, especially after you start adding humans into the mix. Besides dust storms, you’ll have to face off against cold waves and meteors, adding a fun layer to the game.</p><p> Once you get humans on the planet, it turns into a battle for your life. A cold wave can come around and knock out the entire water supply. A dust storm can malfunction all the machines that make oxygen. And a lack of resources aimed to relax humans—dining, shopping, and of course, that famous space bar—can send them teetering over the edge in terms of their mental health. It’s your job to ensure that not only are the humans on Mars healthy, but also happy.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony.</p><p> In over twenty hours of gameplay, I learned the hard way that humans in this game are not only picky, but they demand the life of luxury the second they step off the rocket and into the dome. It didn’t matter that only twelve called a single dome home. It didn’t matter that there was barely enough of them to cover operating the grocery store and space bar. A lack of space for these amenities fell upon deaf ears. They wanted access to their art stores, electronics, and fine dining immediately. In that regard, I’m a little conflicted; as much as I wanted more shopping options for Mars, I realized not long after humans arrived that Haemimont Games, in reality, gave me a blessing by keeping a bland palate. Plus, more buildings and items become available as research, funding, and planetary discoveries allow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QVd7bcTZ_ZbmQxeJCAcRbA8iomg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_04-e663486372a94a05afa9541d4d7930bb.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005196/22899" target="_top" id="2005196">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005196" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005196/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The colonists also come with their own unique personality traits, from veganism to survivalist to alcoholic, so they all have their own service needs. You’ll have to factor this into your game as you build up your population. If someone doesn’t get their needs met, it can land them in the hospital, or worse, on a rocket back home. And don’t get me started on the chaos that erupts when humans start freezing during a cold spell or complain when they don’t have enough oxygen. The nerve of some colonists!</p><p> As my domes grew larger and the population started expanding, engineers would find themselves working in daycares and doctors would be working as security guards. They wouldn’t automatically shift over to open positions at facilities requiring colonists with these backgrounds.</p><p> Thus, the need for micromanagement began, and grew into a big thorn in my side during gameplay.</p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.</p><p> I would have to manually go in and evict them from their homes and shift them to other domes where specialized positions would be. It became frustrating as I built up my population. I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><p> If it wasn’t the micromanagement, the gameplay foreshadowed the slowness of play speed in the beginning. Going into the game, I had no idea how slow it could be. The tutorial said that gameplay can be slow and encouraged the use of the speed buttons at the bottom of the screen. Admittedly, I’m impatient and like to speed up city-builders.</p><p> A good chunk of gameplay before the colonists arrived focused on speeding through slower parts of the game. Once the colonists arrived though, gameplay changed, and I found myself wishing for more hours during Sols, or days, on Mars. It’s a problem at the beginning; later on, not so much, especially when your population grows and you have to mitigate various issues that crop up. Many thanks to the creators for putting in Mars Radio and two other channel options with fun, futuristic music to help get me through until the humans arrive.</p><p> I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><h2 id="Price-Decent-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Decent-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Decent for what you get</strong></h2><p> For around $30, you can add this game to your gaming library. It makes sense for a two-year-old game not to cost the regular price of new games these days. Even better, if you watch for sales, you can get it for cheaper. Be forewarned though—the other additions to the game, like the Laika Project, will cost you more. The $30 is solely for the base game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xyO7-tOzWWRT_ffxzC7TaIMOwH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_03-9d30e99e7a0b4364bc86c4b40dfc99bf.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2127886">                    <video width="576" height="1024" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2127886">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2127886%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2127886/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-building-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-building-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-building games"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-building games</strong></h2><p> What makes Surviving Mars unique is that technically it is a city-<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-offline-building-games-4580415" >building game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but instead of building bus lines, you have to build oxygen and water lines to ensure colony survival. However, just like city-building games, you are building infrastructure. If you’re solely focused on building up a city, Surviving Mars would be a great addition to your library, but so would<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities%5FSkylines/" >Cities: Skylines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). Both focus on creating a habitat from scratch—one just happens to be hundreds of thousands of miles away while the other could be in a tropical or a Midwestern climate.</p><p> If you like to worry about whether or not you are meeting commercial lot demand, or whether you will have to raise taxes to cover the construction of a new fire station, Cities: Skylines is a great option. But it focuses on the present on Earth, so some may feel it’s the same spin on games like the SimCity line that have been around for a while. While you’ll have to worry about budget balancing and fixing congested roadways in Cities: Skylines, you won’t have to worry about ensuring the survival of your people over a malfunctioning water vaporiser.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A interesting new take on city-builders, if you can stomach the micromanagement.</strong></p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.

As streaming services have become commonplace, some subscribers don’t have access to live TV and broadcast channels. Some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provide advanced features, but their designs leave something to be desired. I tested the attractive Antop AT-127 Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a worthy option.</p><h2 id="Design-Reversible-faux-wood-finish"><a href="#Design-Reversible-faux-wood-finish" class="headerlink" title="Design: Reversible faux wood finish"></a><strong>Design: Reversible faux wood finish</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 is one of the better-looking antennas I’ve come across. It’s a thin, plastic rectangular antenna that measures 13 inches wide by nine inches tall. At 0.02 inches in thickness, it’s almost paper-thin, but the plastic feels sturdy enough to withstand regular wear and tear.</p><p> The antenna is reversible, with a light oak finish on one side, and darker wood color on the other. It looks less like an eyesore or something you need to hide, and more like an attractive component, you’re willing to display. The pre-attached coaxial cable comes out of the bottom, which is ideal. You can’t remove the cable from the antenna, which isn’t great for storage, but it does promote stable connectivity.</p><p> The antenna comes with a stand for placement on a desk or entertainment center. It also comes with double-sided adhesives, so you can hang it on a wall or window. The adhesives are extremely sticky—when I pulled the antenna off of my wall, the paint came off along with it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RWXekalxAMy_w61EH_Getqbfiy0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-2-24f94c63d6164dc7a54542cc1e4262c9.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Easier-than-most"><a href="#Setup-Easier-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Easier than most"></a><strong>Setup: Easier than most</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is relatively intuitive. You just connect the antenna to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connection on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to twist onto the threading. This makes for easier setup because you don’t have to struggle behind your TV with trying to screw on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/coaxial-vs-optical-digital-cable-3134605" >coaxial cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Once you connect the antenna’s cable to your TV, you’ll need to find the best placement. This is perhaps the most difficult part of the setup process. My test home is in a wooded area, and I found the best placement was near or directly on the window. However,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >to improve your antenna’s reception <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s usually a good idea to place the antenna high up in a room close to the home’s exterior (and nearest to the transmitter towers) and to avoid obstacles like walls and tree cover.</p><p> The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to screw onto the coax threading.</p><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 supports UHF and VHF signals. Overall, it works pretty smoothly, though some channels might have look pixelated for a few seconds when you flip to them or take a second or two to fully load.</p><p> The attached coax cable isn’t as long as I’ve seen on other similarly-priced antennas, but it is long enough (10 feet) to place the antenna up high without an extender.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5o1YIUg5PeQto5h_Mm6uuK9o5JQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-3-7f7ec909a6b944cabe60862b51a6ba2b.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135394/19272" target="_top" id="2135394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135394/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Could-be-better"><a href="#Range-Could-be-better" class="headerlink" title="Range: Could be better"></a><strong>Range: Could be better</strong></h2><p> My test home is in a rural area, and there’s a lot of tree cover on the property. The omnidirectional Antop AT-127 has a 40-mile range, which was enough to pick up local channels from neighboring cities.</p><p> On my first attempt, I used the included stand, and the auto-programming only picked up four channels. When I placed the antenna on a window facing the TV transmitter tower, however, the omnidirectional HD antenna picked up 23 channels, which is a good amount considering the area.</p><p> The omnidirectional Antop AT-127 has a 40-mile range, enough to pick up local channels from neighboring cities.</p><h2 id="Price-Mid-range"><a href="#Price-Mid-range" class="headerlink" title="Price: Mid-range"></a><strong>Price: Mid-range</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 retails for $35, which is middle of the road for an indoor TV antenna with the Antop’s specs. Some 50-mile (or longer) range antennas sell for as little as $20 or as much as $100, but the cheaper antennas usually don’t look as nice as the AT-127.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Gyp2hHNkH22HeYhnm37WRKC_MHU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-4-baa9b55de12c4a91aa6baad4c8d86272.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Antop-AT-127-vs-AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna"><a href="#Antop-AT-127-vs-AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="Antop AT-127 vs. AmazonBasics Flat TV Antenna"></a><strong>Antop AT-127 vs. AmazonBasics Flat TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> You can find indoor antennas for less than $15 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075ZQXB26/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4845583%7Cna0f30cabffec4337b279a8df3e4c99b015%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).

The Anker PowerDrive 2 is one of the most popular chargers on the market, and it didn’t disappoint during our testing. In addition to its durable plastic construction, it includes a 3-foot micro<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-micro-usb-cables-4178845" >USB cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a dual-port design, and fast recharge rates for your devices thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology.

If you yank a USB cable out of the charger haphazardly, the charger might come apart (we encountered this with the RAVPower 24W USB charger). Not so with the Anker PowerDrive 2 which survived weeks of rigorous testing and careless USB cable unpluggings. It’s also fairly compact. It’ll protrude a bit from the 12V port, but it’s not very noticeable.</p><p> Don’t let the diminutive blue LED light fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously.</p><p> That said, it’s not the prettiest charger. The black plastic construction is fine to look at and blends in nicely with most car interiors, but the red ring around the face makes it look a bit cheap. So, too, does the “IQ” logo printed between the two USB ports, but these are fairly minor quibbles. The PowerDrive 2 has a small and unobtrusive LED light to help you find the USB ports in the dark. We found it less distracting than other chargers we tested.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><h2 id="Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices"><a href="#Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices"></a><strong>Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices</strong></h2><p> The best part of the Anker PowerDrive 2 is its charging. It has the ability to charge iPads simultaneously without getting overheated thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Each USB port can output a maximum 5V&#x2F;2.4A, for a total of 24W. That’s in line with other car<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-phone-chargers-4138571" >chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested, but the PowerIQ technology can help identify device and deliver the fastest possible charge. This also gives you some overvoltage protection to make sure something like a smartwatch doesn’t fry when you plug it in.</p><p> This isn’t quite the same as Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 or other fast charge technologies which vary the voltage and amperage on a larger range, but it’ll top up your phone or other devices faster than a regular charger.</p><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</p><p> One thing to note is that the PowerDrive 2 includes a micro USB cable, in case you don’t want to carry your device’s cable everywhere with you. That’s a nice touch we didn’t get with other chargers we tested.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037338/7443" target="_top" id="2037338">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037338" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037338/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Middle-of-the-pack"><a href="#Price-Middle-of-the-pack" class="headerlink" title="Price: Middle of the pack"></a><strong>Price: Middle of the pack</strong></h2><p> The list price of $14.99 is positioned in the mid-range of the USB charger market, which ranges from just a few dollars to upwards of $50 for some fancier chargers. However, Anker PowerDrive 2 can be had for a discounted price on some websites. Considering the fact that the Anker PowerDrive 2 includes both the fast-charger and a 3-foot micro USB cable, it is well priced for the marketplace.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><h2 id="Competition-A-handful-of-rivals"><a href="#Competition-A-handful-of-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A handful of rivals"></a><strong>Competition: A handful of rivals</strong></h2><p> The RAVPower 24W charger is one of Anker’s main rivals. It has a metal exterior, a lower price tag, and theoretically identical power output. However, its construction is far less robust. In fact, its metal outside easily separates from the internal components easily making Anker a better pick for longevity.</p><p> The Aukey CC-S1 charger is a much closer competitor. It has the standard dual 2.4A USB ports, is constructed from plastic, and costs a few dollars less. One advantage it has is that unlike the PowerDrive, the CC-S1 sits virtually flush to the 12V socket. But you don’t get LED lights, which might make it a hindrance to find at night.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ravpower-24w-usb-car-charger-review-4686799" >RAVPower 24W USB Car Charger Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</strong></p><p> The price is fair, the charging is fast, and the design is unobtrusive.

Its 256GB storage space is impressive, and its read and write (data transfer) speeds reach 420Mbps and 380Mbps, respectively.</p><p> To put these speeds in perspective, imagine you had 2GB of data. At these speeds, it can transfer the files to a computer in about 40 seconds and transfer them back in about 42 seconds.</p><p> For comparison, our budget recommendation (read speed of 100Mbps and write speeds of up to 30–35Mbps) would take about two minutes and 40 seconds to transfer the files to a computer and nearly nine minutes to transfer them back.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-read-and-write-speeds-2640236" >An Explanation of Read and Write Speeds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In addition to its generous storage space and speed, we thoroughly enjoyed its weighty and sturdy feel. Holding it in hand feels just right, with an even weight distribution throughout. An included keychain hole also helps you attach it to whatever you need (hello, backpack pocket liner!).</p><p> While the SanDisk Extreme PRO is a fantastic device, it’s important to note a few design quirks. The retractable plug is convenient feature, but it can sometimes feel stuck and isn’t as smooth as we’d like.</p><p> However, a simple adjustment in how you push the plug can quickly resolve this. Push your thumb against the retractable plug’s side rather than in the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VzaKxOdaMFqGHZPPFjBAiNP-s3Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_SanDisk256GBExtremePROUSB3.2SolidStateFlashDrive-3517c6beda944a6eb980e748d694c880.jpg"                      alt="SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Solid State Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> This minor inconvenience is unlikely to be a major issue unless you use it constantly.</p><p> Another feature we appreciate about the Extreme PRO is the included RescuePRO Deluxe data recovery suite, which makes it very easy to recover accidentally deleted files. Separately, SanDisk SecureAccess software keeps your information secure using 128-bit encryption.</p><p> Overall, we see the SanDisk Extreme PRO as a true jack of all trades, even compared to other higher-end options on the market.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong>  The SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO has received glowing reviews, with Wirecutter recommending it in its USB flash drive guide.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong>  Most buyers have nothing but good things to say about the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO on Amazon. As of now, it has generated more than 4,400 ratings, with an average of 4.7 stars.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151884/7443" target="_top" id="2151884">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151884" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151884/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Also-Great"><a href="#Also-Great" class="headerlink" title="Also Great"></a>Also Great</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX" >Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth 1TB USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5O9M2DYXMkvqQNuAQPz7t89shUM=/fit-in/1500x579/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Corsair-Flash-Survivor-Stealth-1TB-6f7c1dd8417447ca852c5fbfb2d65b95.jpg" >Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth 1TB USB flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084XPB9MX?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB084XPB9MX" >$131 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/data-storage/cmfss3b-1tb/flash-survivor-stealth-1tb-usb-3-0-flash-drive-cmfss3b-1tb" >View on Corsair.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Military-grade aluminum housing</li><li>200-meter waterproof rating</li><li>Monstrous storage capacity (1TB)</li><li>Great for high-quality audio formats like WAV or FLAC</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Quite large (8 inches long)</li><li>Not the most intuitive keychain loop</li></ul><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth earns our second pick thanks to its adventurous spirit, waterproof rating, and rugged military-style aluminum casing.

To put that into perspective, it equates to a whopping 209,000 5MB files, enough for a music library that even the most famous international DJ would need, so you’re well covered. Other storage options (128GB and 256GB) exist as well.</p><p> When it comes to usability, this Flash Survivor Stealth USB simply rocks. Hold it and enjoy a sturdy aluminum construction with center ridges for a comfortable grip.</p><p> It’s also waterproof up to 200 meters, though we were in no hurry to submerge it with valuable data inside and find out if it was true.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983553%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983553/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We also appreciate how the Flash Survivor Stealth USB opens. Grab the keychain loop, unscrew it counterclockwise, and pull it out, revealing the slimmer casing underneath and the USB port. To put it back, pop it in and rotate the end clockwise until it becomes tight (like a bottle cap).</p><p> If there’s one thing we’d improve about the design, it’s the keychain loop. Its integration into the design means the hole is relatively small and difficult to spot. It may also make it hard to clip onto larger key rings. However, keychain loops aren’t crucial for USB flash drives, so we’ll pardon Corsair for this minor usability issue.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth has seen stellar ratings on sites like TweakTown.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> If you look at the Amazon reviews, most Corsair users are pretty ecstatic. Its average 4.5-star rating covers everything from the unit’s durability to its 1TB storage capacity.</p><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xOv4XG2m0FAXv2xnn1MqZOuo9o8=/fit-in/1500x1368/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kingston-DataTraveler70-be3585b8673644689895fb96814e0e4c.jpg" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 USB-C flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >$20 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid storage capacity (256GB)</li><li>Moderate reading and writing speeds</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Plastic end caps can be tricky to remove with moist hands</li><li>Good, but not excellent, build quality</li><li>Not as many Amazon ratings as our other recs</li></ul><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is a budget performer, boasting an impressive 256GB storage capacity (great for the price!) and decent, though not exceptional, build quality.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is one of our favorite budget USB drive options. It’s straightforward with few frills, allowing you to easily store your favorite playlist. It boasts a modest read speed of up to 100Mbps and writes speeds of up to 30–35 Mbps.</p><p> A transfer rate of up to 100Mbps means that a large 1GB file can be transferred in less than 10 seconds straight from your Kingston to your device. It performs pretty well with no lag time in opening files, unlike other comparably priced options we’ve tested that missed the mark.</p><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is pretty basic in terms of design. Shaped like a traditional pen drive, it features a plastic end cap and a slight concave ridge for a sturdy grip. Be sure to have dry hands when pulling off the end cap, as it can get stuck.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We recommend this USB flash drive for anyone seeking a quick and affordable solution. However, if you require the highest storage capacity and fastest read and write speeds possible for a massive music library, stick with the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Solid State Flash Drive.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Sites like Tom’s Hardware have covered the Kingston DataTraveler, highlighting its dominance over generic Amazon USB flash drives.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> Priced at less than $20 and boasting close to 200 ratings with an average of 4.1 stars (as of this writing), Amazon review feedback is generally positive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R0gpCBnrQFQJSKrMdtsqJ1CtoK4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/usb_drives-3e49e18e98274da79cb37d1e49fa99a2.jpg"                      alt="The SanDisk Extreme PRO, Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth, and Kingston DataTraveler 70 USB drives."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><h2 id="How-We-Test"><a href="#How-We-Test" class="headerlink" title="How We Test"></a>How We Test</h2><p> Our recommendations come from three well-known USB drive manufacturers: Kingston, Corsair, and SanDisk. Each excels in different areas.</p><p> To earn passing marks, all of our reviewed USB flash drives must shine in all of the following areas:</p><ul><li>Storage capacity</li><li>Read and write speeds</li><li>Build quality and cost</li></ul><p> Naturally, storage capacity is a matter of preference. An international music DJ may require one terabyte, while a hobbyist may be satisfied with 250GB.</p><p> We also prioritized the highest read and write speeds for our top two picks. Read speed refers to how fast the USB drive can retrieve data from a device (phone, laptop, etc.), whereas write speed refers to how quickly data can be stored.</p><p> If you rarely transfer large files, try to aim for at least 50Mbps read speeds and 20Mbps write speeds. For more regular, large file transfers, we recommend no less than 100Mbps read speeds and 50Mbps write speeds.</p><p> Don’t skimp on build quality either, with a preference toward rugged constructions like the military-grade aluminum Corsair that can withstand plenty of punishment in your bag or purse.</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> When you’re searching for the best overall USB flash drive, it all boils down to individual preferences.</p><p> How many files are you looking to save? For example, if you only have a modest photo library (say, 20,000 5MB photos), then a 100GB USB drive will suffice. Anything more than that, and 256GB or even 1TB options could be your best bet.</p><p> If you only care about fast transfers, try to get the fastest read and write speeds available. Aim for anything over 100 Mbps for read speed and above 30Mbps for writing speed. Remember, writing speed will almost always be slower than reading speed.</p><p> Read our <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-size-usb-flash-drive-do-i-need-2640421" >USB Drive buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148648/16836" target="_top" id="2148648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148648/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Brands-We-Consider"><a href="#Brands-We-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Brands We Consider"></a>Brands We Consider</h3><ul><li>Aneew</li><li>Corsair</li><li>Kingston</li><li>SanDisk</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-flash-drives-for-music-2438381" >The Best USB Flash Drives to Store Music in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Should you buy an external hard drive or a USB flash drive?<br> Consider an external hard drive if you’re looking for a large amount of storage, faster transfer speeds, and don’t mind a large form factor and higher cost. A USB flash drive is the way to go for smaller amounts of data in the most portable size available (and even greater plug-and-play convenience).</li><li>Are USB flash drives good for backing up data long term?<br> Flash drives are some of the less reliable storage mediums and are designed (and best used) as temporary envelopes for data transfer. Traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are the best solution for long-term backup, providing the most data stability and capacity for the price. Or, for a faster solution at a higher price tag, consider a solid disk drive (SSD).</li><li>What’s the difference between USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB-C flash drives?<br> The USB standard a flash drive is built around will determine its potential performance, including the maximum transfer rate. For instance, the transfer ceiling for USB 3.0 is theoretically ten times higher than 2.0. Letters following a USB designation (like USB-A, USB-B, or USB-C) indicate the physical type of connection; USB-A is the familiar rectangle most associated with the standard, while USB-C is a reversible flat oval.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-how-to-record-a-voice-over-for-a-video-in-2024/"><u>[New] How To Record A Voice Over For A Video, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-tighten-up-your-timeline-youtube-video-trimming-techniques/"><u>[New] Tighten Up Your Timeline YouTube Video Trimming Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-a-trio-of-dimensions-differentiating-the-futures-tech-trio-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Trio of Dimensions Differentiating the Future's Tech Trio for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-complete-walkthrough-mastering-adobe-cloud-services/"><u>[Updated] Complete Walkthrough Mastering Adobe Cloud Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-practices-in-upgrading-to-a-high-end-4k-camera-lens/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Practices in Upgrading to a High-End 4K Camera Lens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/2024s-top-performers-best-combined-cable-modem-and-routers/"><u>2024'S Top Performers: Best Combined Cable Modem and Routers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/5-star-choices-the-finest-mice-compatible-with-macs/"><u>5 Star Choices: The Finest Mice Compatible with Macs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-microsoft-surface-laptop-go-critique-the-perfect-mix-of-mobility-and-power/"><u>Affordable Microsoft Surface Laptop Go Critique: The Perfect Mix of Mobility & Power</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-premium-viewing-in-depth-hisense-50-h8f-4k-hdr-television-evaluation/"><u>Affordable Premium Viewing: In-Depth Hisense 50 H8F 4K HDR Television Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-wall-mounting-showcased-md2380-review/"><u>Affordable Wall Mounting Showcased - MD2380 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/beginners-guide-to-masterful-marketing-with-reddit-insights/"><u>Beginner's Guide to Masterful Marketing with Reddit Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ing-visual-wonders-home-made-effects-demystified-for-2024/"><u>Crafting Visual Wonders Home-Made Effects Demystified for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/evaluating-the-enduring-appeal-of-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s3-a-detailed-analysis/"><u>Evaluating the Enduring Appeal of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 - A Detailed Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/1722629709644-get-ready-for-action-dive-into-a-vibrant-new-season-of-fortnite-review-and-strategy/"><u>Get Ready for Action!

I spent 15 hours putting it to the test, read on to see how I liked it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XdJMKZTDX0bcXYVWQa5F4sXhnt0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FireCubeTV_HeroHoriz-bb386a84025b49d2a22d3d34c6974007.jpg"                      alt="Fire TV Cube (2nd Generation)"                ></p><p> Lifewire&#x2F;Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982499">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982499">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982499%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982499/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Futuristic-design-powered-by-Alexa"><a href="#Design-Futuristic-design-powered-by-Alexa" class="headerlink" title="Design: Futuristic design powered by Alexa"></a><strong>Design: Futuristic design powered by Alexa</strong></h2><p> The Fire TV Cube is a cute, futuristic-looking block that will stand out on your home console despite its 4-inch sides. On the outside, it’s virtually unchanged from the first-generation model. Across the top, there’s a blue LED bar that lights up whenever the Cube takes action. The sides of the cube have a glossy black finish that’s a fingerprint magnet. There’s volume and menu buttons on the top, as well, but we don’t foresee a lot of use for them considering that the Cube comes with a remote. In the back, there’s an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI connector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a power adapter port, and a micro USB port.</p><p> In order to give users flexibility in how they set up their streaming system, Amazon’s built-in eight directional microphones into the Fire TV Cube, and another into the remote. As long as the Cube is at least a foot away from any audio output sources (i.e. speakers), it should have no problem hearing your voice commands from ten or more feet away.</p><p> The Cube’s voice commands are probably its most distinguishing feature. Unlike the Fire TV Sticks, the Fire TV Cube also functions as an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa speaker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , meaning it will respond to any voice commands, and more importantly, it has the same capabilities as an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/echo-plus-2nd-gen-review-4772306" >Amazon Echo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In other words, it can control your Internet of Things devices, such as smart bulbs, thermostats, and Ring doorbells.</p><p> You will also receive an Alexa-enabled remote with your Cube. It has buttons to navigate the UI, but it also has volume and power buttons that will work with your TV. It’s small, about the size of your palm, and it has a matte black finish that will make it easy to grip. The relatively large buttons make it simple to navigate the Cube without looking at the remote, as well.</p><p> The Amazon Fire TV Cube is a fantastic streamer for those committed to the Alexa ecosystem.</p><p> My biggest pet peeve with the Cube’s design and features is its accessory bundle. For $120, Amazon could have afforded to throw in an HDMI cable—the $30 Roku Express has one, for instance. If you end up purchasing a Cube, remember to also get an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-cables-and-connectors-what-you-need-to-know-4685377" >HDMI cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . I’ve found Blue Rigger strikes a great balance between affordability and quality, if you need a recommendation.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Some-difficulty-in-getting-ready"><a href="#Setup-Process-Some-difficulty-in-getting-ready" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Some difficulty in getting ready"></a><strong>Setup Process: Some difficulty in getting ready</strong></h2><p> Compared to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review-4691492" >Fire TV Stick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Cube is a little harder to set up— it doesn’t automatically boot like the Stick, and you need to take into consideration its IR receivers. It must have a clear line of sight to your remote, so place it somewhere you can see it. Additionally, if you want to take advantage of its 4K capabilities, you’ll likely want to use the included Ethernet adapter (and you’ll need to acquire an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> Once you have your cables connected and power flowing to the Cube, you now need to go through the software side of setup. It’ll ask you to connect to Internet, pick out some apps&#x2F;channels, and log into your Amazon account.</p><h2 id="Streaming-Performance-Fast-streaming-and-almost-no-buffering"><a href="#Streaming-Performance-Fast-streaming-and-almost-no-buffering" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Performance: Fast streaming and almost no buffering"></a><strong>Streaming Performance: Fast streaming and almost no buffering</strong></h2><p> With a hexa-core processor and an ARM Mali G52-MP2 GPU, the Fire TV Cube is blazing fast. Any trouble streaming 4K content is going to come from your internet connection. When I tested it, content loaded instantly, with little to no buffer time and instant thumbnail loading.</p><p> Video looks vivid, and audio sounds great thanks to HDCP support and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >Dolby Vision <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> encoding. I had no trouble getting my content in surround sound and in HDR, without any additional setup from my audio system or 4K projector. Video would consistently stream at 4K 60fps.</p><p> If a show was particularly loud, Alexa had some trouble hearing me, but it was a quick fix by lowering or muting the volume. Alexa never confused the content audio for a command. However, while I didn’t have a problem with having Alexa understand my commands, I would be a little warier if your accent deviates strongly from standard American English. Google’s language recognition protocols tend to be better with understanding other languages and accents.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O-RbJQ9z0Q90LRS1tw4p-LYm-Xc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FIreCubeTV_03-525c653ed76f4b72bcd57495c1bc3142-55e4717a457d48aa8324c37542b70f01.jpg"                      alt="Fire TV Cube (2nd Generation)"                ></p><p>Lifewire&#x2F;Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Software-Heavily-biased-toward-Amazon-services"><a href="#Software-Heavily-biased-toward-Amazon-services" class="headerlink" title="Software: Heavily biased toward Amazon services"></a><strong>Software: Heavily biased toward Amazon services</strong></h2><p> Software is simultaneously Fire TV’s strongest and weakest point. On the one hand, the quantity of content available on the Fire TV platform is astounding—there’s over 5,000 apps to choose from, as well as a meager library of simple games to play. If you’re looking for something, you will find it.</p><p> However, you will have to find it in a sea of Amazon content. Fire TV’s interface heavily favors content from<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-video-4176363" >Prime Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and this becomes doubly apparent the further you scroll on the home screen. I happen to love quite a few of the Emmy-winning originals on Prime, so it doesn’t bother me so much, but I can see it becoming infuriating if you just want neutral recommendations (Roku’s software is much better at feeling impartial).</p><p> The home screen isn’t particularly well-organized. Your apps make up the top row, and the rest are suggested content (usually Amazon content). Searching for shows on the search bar will show Amazon results first, and other apps second. Once you’re within an app’s menu, it’s not so bad. Netflix, for instance, works the same as it would on any other streaming device.</p><p> There’s a lot of excellent apps on the platform, from YouTube to IMDb to Crackle TV. There’s weather apps, news apps, and sports apps for all tastes. There’s even a few music streaming apps, including Spotify and Amazon Music.</p><p> If you want an Echo that’s also a media player, the Cube is your best option. It comes with excellent performance, control for IoT devices, built-in speaker and mic, and svelte looks.</p><p> If you’re interested in a Cube because you love Amazon products and content, you’ll be pleased with Prime’s selection of video. There are many, many shows included with your Prime subscription, a lot of them with a stellar production team. Almost all Amazon originals are filmed in 4K, so you can get the most out of your Cube’s performance capabilities. If you haven’t already, you should watch The Expanse and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/21Mjfh9xUyCrX05R6TQdh9JX64c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FireCubeTV_02-603b91304a21457c94312ceb97dfcf74.jpg"                      alt="Fire TV Cube (2nd Generation)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977004">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977004">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977004%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977004/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire&#x2F;Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Price-On-the-expensive-side"><a href="#Price-On-the-expensive-side" class="headerlink" title="Price: On the expensive side"></a><strong>Price: On the expensive side</strong></h2><p> The Fire TV Cube costs $120, which is frankly a little expensive compared to the Fire TV Stick 4K or an Amazon Echo. However, if you want an Echo that’s also a media player, the Cube is your best option. It comes with excellent performance, control for IoT devices, built-in speaker and mic, and svelte looks. While it’s not the best value streaming device, it’s certainly a versatile and well-featured one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/994842/11832" target="_top" id="994842">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-994842" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/994842/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Amazon-Fire-TV-Cube-vs-Roku-Ultra"><a href="#Amazon-Fire-TV-Cube-vs-Roku-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Fire TV Cube vs. Roku Ultra"></a><strong>Amazon Fire TV Cube vs. Roku Ultra</strong></h2><p> There’s a lot to consider if you’re choosing between the Roku Ultra and the Fire TV Cube. Specs-wise, the Fire TV Cube is undoubtedly more powerful and supports more codecs. However, the Roku Ultra has more than enough power to handle 4K content, and it supports HDR, so only the pickiest film lovers would even notice the difference.</p><p> Roku has the advantage when it comes to software, with the biggest and most varied library of any streaming platform. Both its menus and its search function are platform agnostic, meaning it’s simply interested in presenting you the most relevant and cost-effective results. For those that like quiet listening, you can also sync audio to your phone or the remote and listen with your headphones. Meanwhile, the Fire TV Cube has IoT integration.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A powerful streaming device with lots of added functionality.</strong></p><p> The Amazon Fire TV Cube is a fantastic streamer for those committed to the Alexa ecosystem. However, it’s a little expensive if you only want reliable 4K streaming, in which case you may be better served by the Fire TV Stick 4K or the Roku Streaming Stick+ for $50.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Fire TV Cube</li><li>Product Brand  Amazon</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2019</li><li>Weight  12.9 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.4 x 3.4 x 3 in.</li><li>Processor  Hexa-core (Quad-core at up to 2.2GHz + Dual-core at up to 1.9GHz)</li><li>GPU  ARM Mali G52-MP2 (3EE), 800MHz</li><li>RAM  2GB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-precision-in-online-viewing-a-zoomers-handbook/"><u>[New] Precision in Online Viewing A Zoomer's Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-broadcast-your-best-gameplay-from-xbox-to-fb-live/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Broadcast Your Best Gameplay From Xbox to FB Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-elites-choice-top-6-superior-4k-dslr-powerhouses/"><u>[Updated] Elite's Choice Top 6 Superior 4K DSLR Powerhouses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-secrets-to-audio-visual-cohesion-on-facebook/"><u>2024 Approved Unveiling the Secrets to Audio-Visual Cohesion on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/elevate-your-workspace-with-the-chic-and-contemporary-theodore-desk-by-flexispot/"><u>Elevate Your Workspace with the Chic and Contemporary Theodore Desk by Flexispot</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/examining-the-changes-in-the-newly-released-samsung-s21/"><u>Examining the Changes in the Newly Released Samsung S21</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/follower-erosion-how-to-spot-it-on-insta/"><u>Follower Erosion How to Spot It on Insta</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/future-proof-skills-top-coding-course-picks-to-master/"><u>Future-Proof Skills: Top Coding Course Picks to Master</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-fitbit-charge-6-tracker-performance/"><u>In-Depth Analysis: Fitbit Charge 6 Tracker Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-evaluation-of-ankers-superspeed-30-usb-hub-your-key-to-expanded-power/"><u>In-Depth Evaluation of Anker's SuperSpeed 3.0 USB Hub: Your Key to Expanded Power</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-the-hisense-40h5590f-a-value-packed-entry-level-smart-tv-experience/"><u>In-Depth Look at the Hisense 40H5590F: A Value-Packed Entry-Level Smart TV Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-the-viair-88ps-mighty-performance-and-slight-disadvantages-in-air-compression/"><u>In-Depth Look at the Viair 88P's Mighty Performance and Slight Disadvantages in Air Compression</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-transforming-mp4-files-into-avi-format-using-handbrake/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Transforming MP4 Files Into AVI Format Using HandBrake</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/step-by-step-solutions-for-fixing-the-notorious-504-gateway-timeout-error-quickly/"><u>Step-by-Step Solutions for Fixing the Notorious 504 Gateway Timeout Error Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/wondering-the-best-alternative-to-hola-on-apple-iphone-se-2022-here-is-the-answer-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Wondering the Best Alternative to Hola On Apple iPhone SE (2022)?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses roughly the same design as many of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, and it didn’t give the absolute best results either. Nonetheless, it’s still going to be the best choice for a really large segment of buyers out there simply because of how aggressively its priced.</p><p> If you are living inside of a large metropolitan area, you likely don’t need the best possible antenna to pick up the channels being broadcast to you over the air. Furthermore, I didn’t see that big of a difference in performance as price increased. Unless you step it all the way up to a much larger, much more expensive solution, the difference in performance is probably not worth it, which is why the 1byone is an easy recommendation. Let’s see how it performed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FEdsHVNn7IxwxXsSkRT0jxmmRuQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_02-d797d473ec154becbab8a3023cff8b53.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137212/26400" target="_top" id="2137212">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137212" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137212/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Vanilla"><a href="#Design-Vanilla" class="headerlink" title="Design: Vanilla"></a><strong>Design: Vanilla</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses a flat rectangular design similar to other powered indoor antennas on the market. The 13.25 x 9.25 inch antenna surface is roughly in line with most of the other products I looked at in this category, the only real difference being that the 1byone has a much more rigid surface.</p><p> Being a powered antenna, the 1byone uses an external amplifier to boost the signal. This box contains a coaxial input attached via the included 16.5ft cable, and has a power input, which can be supplied by the TV itself if it can support USB power. Otherwise, 1byone includes a USB power adapter.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fairly-intuitive"><a href="#Setup-Fairly-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fairly intuitive"></a><strong>Setup: Fairly intuitive</strong></h2><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas. Simply attach the 16.5ft coaxial cable to the external amplifier, connect the power to a USB power source, and then attach the coaxial cable from the amplifier to your TV.</p><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136620/26400" target="_top" id="2136620">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136620" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136620/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Good-enough-for-most"><a href="#Performance-Good-enough-for-most" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Good enough for most"></a><strong>Performance: Good enough for most</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna didn’t have the best performance of the antennas we’ve tested, falling somewhere in the middle of the pack. In my channel acquisition test, I averaged 59 channels across all the tests performed. This compares to the worst performing antenna at just 47, and the best at 76.</p><p> This should be more than suitable for most people living within a city in relatively close proximity to the source of the TV signal. As for those living further, your mileage may vary.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123735/7443" target="_top" id="2123735">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123735" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123735/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Middle-of-the-road"><a href="#Range-Middle-of-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Range: Middle of the road"></a><strong>Range: Middle of the road</strong></h2><p> 1byone makes no specific promises about the range of their antenna, although they do cite users having positive experiences from as far as 48 miles away in their customer testimonials. Given how many factors impact the effective range, I think it is somewhat wise not to make any promises. Nonetheless, this is clearly a device that will be best suited for people living in or near major metropolitan areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6y-ITpY8n7xf8BteMqdJjYm-paU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_05-178a02351af040cc89c86169b88a6de2.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657396/16446" target="_top" id="1657396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657396/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-great-deal"><a href="#Price-A-great-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great deal"></a><strong>Price: A great deal</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna costs just $25, making it the least expensive option out of the antennas I tested. It picked up all the major channels that I would actually watch, and didn’t have any issues with the signal. So from my perspective, why would I pay more? I think buyers would probably be best served by seeing if an antenna like this works for them. If you discover you need something more substantial, feel free to move on to a pricier option.</p><h2 id="1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna"><a href="#1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna"></a><strong>1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Another popular manufacturer is Mohu, and the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna offers a simpler, non-amplified solution that only loses out on a hair of performance versus the 1byone. I preferred the build quality of the Mohu Leaf, if only marginally, and like the simplicity of not needing additional wires and boxes hanging out of my TV.</p><p> At the end of the day though, the 1byone performs better and costs less money, so it’s not the easiest argument to make.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The overall best value.</strong></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna offers the best value out of all the indoor antennas that we tested. If you can get the performance you need from the 1byone, it’s the antenna to buy. I wouldn’t consider other options unless you’ve already ruled out this one.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Amplified Digital HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  1byone</li><li>Price  $25.00</li><li>Release Date  December 2014</li><li>Weight  9.3 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  13.6 x 2 x 10.4 in.</li><li>Color  White</li><li>Powered  Yes</li><li>Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor  Indoor</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-skills-for-high-quality-screen-recordings-using-nvidia-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Skills for High-Quality Screen Recordings Using NVIDIA for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/an-overview-of-the-dell-inspiron-3671-desktop-delving-into-its-modest-midrange-capabilities/"><u>An Overview of the Dell Inspiron 3671 Desktop - Delving Into Its Modest Midrange Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/apc-back-ups-pro-1500va-unveiled-powerful-performance-with-hot-swap-feature/"><u>APC Back-UPS Pro 1500VA Unveiled - Powerful Performance with Hot Swap Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/apc-ups-model-1500va-in-depth-review-maximum-power-output-convenient-ports-and-battery-replacement/"><u>APC UPS Model 1500VA - In-Depth Review: Maximum Power Output, Convenient Ports & Battery Replacement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/asus-rt-ac88u-gaming-router-review/"><u>Asus RT-AC88U Gaming Router Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/compact-ourlink-u631-wireless-nac-usb-dongle-with-robust-speed-and-reliability/"><u>Compact Ourlink U631 Wireless N/AC USB Dongle with Robust Speed and Reliability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/how-to-add-videos-in-instagram-story-for-2024/"><u>How to Add Videos in Instagram Story for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-vivo-s18-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Vivo S18 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-clips-to-masterpiece-essential-video-editing-tips-for-home-movie-makers/"><u>In 2024, From Clips to Masterpiece Essential Video Editing Tips for Home Movie Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/masterful-aid-creation-simplified-the-best-7-cybernetic-tools/"><u>Masterful Aid Creation Simplified: The Best 7 Cybernetic Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/play-uninterrupted-solutions-to-prevent-fall-guys-from-freezing-on-your-desktop-computer/"><u>Play Uninterrupted: Solutions to Prevent Fall Guys From Freezing on Your Desktop Computer</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You generally want a sound card with a signal-to-noise ratio over 100dB, but the best sound cards are in the 124dB range, which is a significant improvement.</p><p><strong>Channels</strong> - Many decent, budget-friendly sound cards typically support 5.1 channel audio, but you can spend a little more to get one that can handle 7.1 surround sound. Some can even up-mix 5.1 channel audio to 7.1, which is excellent if your headphones support 7.1 channels and your audio sources don’t.</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong> - Look for a sound card with the jacks you need to plug in your equipment. Basic sound cards have 3.5mm jacks that work fine with most headphones and headsets, but look for one with RCA jacks or a TOSLINK optical connection if you’re hooking up to audio equipment that requires them.</p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Why does my PC need a sound card?<br> Nearly all computers (desktops and laptops) available in the market feature integrated (on the motherboard) audio functionality, which ensures that both built-in (e.g., speakers) and external (e.g., earphones) work as intended. If you want to use your PC with high-end gear like studio headphones and home theater systems, you need a sound card capable of driving all this additional hardware. It’s also crucial if you want to enjoy high-resolution lossless music.</li><li>Should I go for an internal or an external sound card?<br> Generally speaking, internal sound cards are more powerful. They plug directly into your desktop PC’s motherboard, offering features like switchable op-amp chips and many connectivity ports. However, external sound cards are the way to go if your target device is a laptop PC (or a gaming console).</li><li>Can I install&#x2F;set up the sound card myself?<br> Installing most internal sound cards isn’t hard since you simply plug them into your motherboard’s expansion slot. External sound cards are easier to set up since they usually get powered via a USB port. In both cases, you must configure the associated drivers (if any) to get things up and running.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-capacity-limit-how-many-vids-in-128gb/"><u>[New] Capacity Limit How Many Vids in 128GB?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/rom-end-to-start-annoying-yourself-with-yt-playlist-upside-down-for-2024/"><u>[New] From End to Start Annoying Yourself with YT Playlist Upside-Down for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-revenue-revolution-unlocking-online-income-through-youtube-monetization/"><u>[Updated] Revenue Revolution Unlocking Online Income Through YouTube Monetization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/asus-zenwifi-xt8-ax6600-comprehensive-rating-and-analysis-for-a-robust-tri-band-wireless-network/"><u>ASUS ZenWifi XT8 (AX6600) - Comprehensive Rating & Analysis for a Robust Tri-Band Wireless Network</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-the-kootek-laptop-cooling-pad-a-solid-pick-for-optimal-performance/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad: A Solid Pick for Optimal Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-asus-zephyrus-g14-assessment-the-ultimate-all-rounder-in-portable-gaming/"><u>Comprehensive Asus Zephyrus G14 Assessment: The Ultimate All-Rounder in Portable Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-unboxing-the-linksys-wrt1900acs-an-openness-in-home-networks/"><u>Comprehensive Guide: Unboxing the Linksys WRT1900ACS, an Openness in Home Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-topstorm-tracker-applications-to-keep-you-informed/"><u>Comprehensive Review: Topstorm Tracker Applications to Keep You Informed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/countering-phishing-in-fake-chatgpt-websites/"><u>Countering Phishing in Fake ChatGPT Websites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/culinary-carnage-and-fun-in-overcooked-2-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>Culinary Carnage & Fun in 'Overcooked! 2': A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/evaluating-the-sound-experience-bose-quiet-control-30-insights/"><u>Evaluating the Sound Experience: Bose Quiet Control 30 Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/evaluation-is-investing-in-an-ipad-worth-your-money/"><u>Evaluation: Is Investing in an iPad Worth Your Money?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/how-to-reboot-your-network-connection-by-flushing-dns-in-windows-10-and-11/"><u>How to Reboot Your Network Connection by Flushing DNS in Windows 10 and 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-honor-magic5-ultimate-to-iphone-xs11-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Honor Magic5 Ultimate to iPhone XS/11 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-beat-architect-techniques-for-isolating-and-repurposing-kernels-in-audio/"><u>In 2024, The Beat Architect Techniques for Isolating and Repurposing Kernels in Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/secure-your-images-steps-to-locking-photos-on-ios-devices/"><u>Secure Your Images: Steps to Locking Photos on iOS Devices</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This promises to be one of the most expansive and unique games in a long line of genre-defining titles with an enormous open world map and a wealth of engaging stories and activities to participate in. Valhalla builds on many of the mechanics players first saw in Assassins’s Creed: Origins and Odyssey, containing more RPG elements, a variety of combat styles, and plenty of upgrades.</p><p> I played the game on PC for several days, but it’s also available on all other major platforms including the upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/price-release-date-specs-xbox-series-x-5077092" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Xbox One, upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-4778089" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and PlayStation 4.</p><h2 id="Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled"><a href="#Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled" class="headerlink" title="Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled"></a><strong>Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled</strong></h2><p> There’s a lot to say here, but not much that can be said without spoilers. Given how engaging I found the plot, it would be a shame to spoil it in any way. Suffice it to say that, though it begins as a typical revenge story, it soon becomes more complex and interesting. You play as Eivor, a male or female warrior who raids England during the reign of Alfred the Great.</p><p> Aside from the basis in history, there are fascinating mythological elements to the storyline, and obviously, much attention was paid to crafting an authentic recreation of the cultures being represented here. The game does a good job of focusing on telling a story about Vikings, while also working the series namesake “Assassins” into the mix in a plausible manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pWujlWPf0ylYYpeoTEbp7X8U0yM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-4-07677871281c40a384f2df55f83e86a4.jpg"                      alt="AC Vallhalla 2"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Perhaps more interesting than the main plot are the side quests sprinkled liberally about the world. These are typically informal, chance encounters and, though they do grant experience towards skill points, their primary point is to tell an intriguing story, which they accomplish with aplomb. The characters are almost invariably well-acted, and while short, these quests are remarkably well written and worth seeking out.</p><p> The prologue map alone in Norway covers 15 square kilometers, and has between 10 and 15 hours worth of gameplay. It honestly is worth the cost of admission in its own right. I could easily have spent 20 hours there just climbing mountains. However, the core of the game is set in England, and the map is absolutely gigantic.</p><p> In total, the game’s various open world areas cover a staggering 140 square kilometers, nearly ten times the size of the prologue area. By this rough estimate, there should be at least 120 hours worth of content in this game, including a roughly 60-hour main campaign. Missions, mysteries, and treasure in abundance ensure that the wilderness never grows stale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vk4XvoE4lJwcjde1C_tJUVBc0Ac=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-9-a5e8ef2a5bef455d8cbaa9e749167f53.jpg"                      alt="AC sneak"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137204/26400" target="_top" id="2137204">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137204" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137204/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master"><a href="#Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master"></a><strong>Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master</strong></h2><p> Valhalla’s gameplay will be familiar to fans of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, particularly the more recent entries in the series. As usual, there are tweaks and innovations, but it was easy enough for me to pick up, with my most recent experience being with AC Unity. Players who’ve played Origins and Odyssey will find much to be familiar. The fluid movement and iconic parkour makes navigating around the expansive open world fun and engaging, though novices may accidentally fling themselves off a cliff or two by accident as they learn the ropes.</p><p> Fall damage is back, but don’t worry though, most falls won’t kill you, and you can just scarf a few berries and be right as rain. It’s worth the risk, as climbing mountains is in itself an activity that offers hours of freeform fun. As is traditional for Assassin’s Creed games, you can safely leap from any high place so long as there is a pile of hay, leaves, or a shallow pond to break your fall.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells.</p><p> There are traditional observation points to unlock, but there are also plenty of interesting peaks, spires, and mountain tops with unique views to discover. Most aren’t marked, so there’s a sense of discovery in seeking them out, and thanks to a robust photo mode, it’s fun to document your hiking and climbing adventures.</p><p> Traveling long distances around the map can be done via unlockable fast travel locations, but the vast, beautiful world crafted for Valhalla encouraged me to explore it on foot, even for paths I had trodden more than once. This is aided by your ability to summon a horse or a longboat to your position, either of which is an exciting way to travel.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells. Alternatively, your bard may accompany your seafaring with diverting tales. If there’s one downside is that unlike Odyssey, there’s no ship-to-ship naval combat, but perhaps that makes sense because the Vikings were more land raiders despite their extensive use of longboats to travel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/giaP-JV9QK6uFcdU_di4iWkvszw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-5-56a01de51a2a4540ae8650bece502873.jpg"                      alt="AC Valhalla 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137226/26400" target="_top" id="2137226">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137226" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137226/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Combat is fast, brutal, and varied with deep customization and different potential approaches. There are many ways to approach each situation, and none of them are wrong. You can sneak in and pick the enemy off one by one, dumping their carcasses in bushes so as not to tip off their friends, or you can nail them from a distance with arrows. Alternatively, you can stride in, axes twirling, and cut a bloody swath through your foes.</p><p> Skill points are given to you as you level up and can be used to upgrade your character and hone their skill in ranged, stealth, or melee fields. Abilities can also be discovered by reading books hidden throughout the world. This is the main way you can specialize your character build. If you want a more traditional assassin experience, put all your points into stealth or ranged, but if you want to live your life as a brutal Viking warlord, go all-in on melee. My favorite move is one in which you hurl throwing axes all around you in slow motion.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side. Even better are raids, where you leap from your ship among a horde of screaming Vikings to slay your enemies and loot their towns.</p><p> Raiding becomes a vital component of the game, as raids are the only way to build your settlement. It’s not a particularly complex base building mechanic, as it only involves raiding the requisite supplies and returning them to your settlement, whereupon a new building magically appears. It’s fun to watch your settlement grow, and you gradually unlock a variety of different functions and quests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/n9S5L4JClTiqP1vYa_7cTGw6o0c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-7-d89d4a9941b8488ea6ef1aeba6486895.jpg"                      alt="AC ship"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize"><a href="#Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize" class="headerlink" title="Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize"></a><strong>Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize</strong></h2><p> Valhalla gives you plenty of ways to customize your experience.

I particularly enjoyed Flyting, which is a battle of words These are timed, competitive poetry contests where you must quickly select the most appropriate verse from a list of options. It’s both amusing and character building.</p><p> Orlog is an interesting dice game that I would honestly like to own in real life, and the drinking minigame is a highly enjoyable reflex-based challenge. A nice touch is that the results of imbibing huge amounts of mead persist for a period of time after the minigame is complete. After all, are you really a Viking warrior if you’re not completely drunk all the time?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/trRirIDsjFej03o-_HDCFsnnrzs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-6-5449cde060b441a499a5189fda9a7a0a.jpg"                      alt="AC tattoos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094482/7443" target="_top" id="2094482">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak"><a href="#Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak" class="headerlink" title="Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak"></a><strong>Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak</strong></h2><p> As in Odyssey, the game allows you to play as either male or female, and offers a range of cosmetic options, mainly by way of tattoos and hairstyles. New tattoo patterns are acquired through parkour challenges. What’s more interesting is the gameplay affecting clothing and weapons that alter your appearance—I particularly appreciated that upgrading those items affects their looks. You can choose from different ravens and horses, and change the appearance of your longship. Eventually, you will also be able to customize the appearance of your settlement.</p><p> I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Epic-good-looks"><a href="#Graphics-Epic-good-looks" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Epic good looks"></a><strong>Graphics: Epic good looks</strong></h2><p> Valhalla is an absolutely gorgeous game. Everything from the detailed character models to the vibrant open world is beautiful to look upon. Changing weather alters the mood of landscapes, and can create breathtaking moments. I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><p> Towns and cities are richly detailed, with people going about their daily business in this muddy and gritty medieval setting. The wilderness is also magnificent, with wild natural beauty and towering ruins in equal measure. Wildlife and farm animals are both present in this world, adding vibrancy to the countryside.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YazM4IIiw6qfR_cd-AfR8Cek9pg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-10-b813058de14c4b92978d22f84715ab98.jpg"                      alt="AC Mountain"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Performance: A rough start"></a><strong>Setup Process and Performance: A rough start</strong></h2><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla is typical of modern AAA titles in that it requires a big download and a considerable amount of storage space to house on your PC or console. With the day one update to consider, you’re looking at around 50GB.</p><p> Now, keep in mind that these are my pre-launch experiences with the game not fully patched. I initially installed it on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, which I reviewed recently and found to be capable of running modern titles at high or max settings. However, Valhalla appears to be a whole different kind of beast and played havoc on my machine.</p><p> When I first jumped into the game after the intro cutscene, I was greeted with the most horrendous graphics glitching I’ve ever experienced. Thinking this was because I had foolishly maxed the settings I restarted after tweaking down graphics, but upon restart, the glitches were appearing in the menu itself. I exited the game and the glitches persisted for about 10 seconds after Valhalla had closed. The built-in benchmarking tool in the game refused to run entirely. In the end, I decided not to push my luck with the laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R1pb8_CqlpJqAmK9Ka9-pgyOyJk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-3-ea07cee8afaa4cc89c4e2bb286b894a0.jpg"                      alt="AC ruins"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> On a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-pcs-4045451" >gaming PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a more powerful processor, more RAM, and an RTX 2070<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-graphics-cards-4692676" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , I didn’t encounter any glitches. However, the game is extremely power-hungry, and I was only able to run it at max settings with 60fps at 1080p. Ubisoft titles are known for being poorly optimized at launch, so this game should perform better after a few patches. Still, it’s clearly designed for next-gen consoles and the latest PC hardware.

That will include the planned expansions which will add Ireland and France to the map. Expensive though $100 is, it does promise a potentially huge amount of content. The game also has microtransactions, which is a bit of a bummer, though these weren’t integrated into the game at the time of writing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/teY5MG-6xAT5sxNurIFy_iYPPvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-2-58ab82ef1f624e01b1c1c6dab8bca06b.jpg"                      alt="AC horse"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062450/7443" target="_top" id="1062450">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062450" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062450/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion"><a href="#Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion" class="headerlink" title="Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion"></a><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion</strong></h2><p> It’s interesting that Ubisoft decided to launch two third-person action games set in England within a span of a few weeks. Where Valhalla is set in the Middle Ages,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-new-setting-for-the-series-5085469" >Watch Dogs: Legion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is set in a near-future sci-fi dystopia, though in both games you are battling against tyrannical rulers in England. Choose Watch Dogs if you want sci-fi focused on hackers and non-violent solutions, and Valhalla if you love bloody medieval fighting and exploration.</p><p> It’s also worth mentioning the resemblance between Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla to The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. The comparison is inescapable due to the fact that both are based on Norse culture. While Valhalla is certainly a more historically grounded game as opposed to Skyrim’s totally fictional fantasy realm, Valhalla will nonetheless be familiar and exciting for fans of Skyrim.</p><p> Final Verdict: Epic stories and exciting combat in a sprawling open world.</p><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla exceeds, as Assassin’s Creed games so often do, in creating the most painstakingly detailed virtual recreation of a place and period possible. It’s got exploration, intense combat, and enthralling stories by the bucket full, and it’s easy to get lost in its sheer scope and scale.

Star Wars: Squadrons grants you the second of these fantasies to a never before seen degree. This long-overdue follow up to the 1993 classic Star Wars: X-Wing aims to offer the same intense dogfighting, but with the advantages of modern tech. I reviewed the PC version.</p><h2 id="Setup-Some-tinkering-required"><a href="#Setup-Some-tinkering-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Some tinkering required"></a><strong>Setup: Some tinkering required</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons has a fairly hefty download before it’s playable, so be sure your hard drive has at least 26.4 GB of storage space. When the game boots up you can alter basic settings to set language, volume, display settings, and everything else needed to optimize your experience. I struggled a bit to get it to play well with my dual-screen setup, but eventually, I was able to get it to a playable state on my ultra-widescreen Samsung CHG90 display. In the end, I found it more comfortable to play on a standard 16:9 aspect ratio monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1xt9t7ffMjuv6ggtXGJER_irSnk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-2-fcfb7e9a60e74ce9b42cecff0e2061ed.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps"><a href="#Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps" class="headerlink" title="Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps"></a><strong>Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps</strong></h2><p> The game picks up after the destruction of Alderaan in A New Hope. You get to play both sides of the conflict in alternating story missions as both an Imperial pilot and a Rebel pilot. Both characters are customizable with a range of preset options. I always appreciate it when a game gives me the option to create my own character.</p><p> The range of presets is fairly limited, but welcome nonetheless. As is traditional for me, I chose to rename the protagonists after characters from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. The Rebel hero became Lu-Tze, with the evil Vorbis on the side of the Empire. I was happy to be able to find a suitably sinister British accent for Vorbis, though hilarious results are possible with mismatched voices and characters. In the end, though, you’ll be spending most of the game from a first-person perspective, with your character only briefly present in cutscenes.</p><p>Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p> Next, you can choose whether you’d like a more guided experience with the standard HUD, or if you’d prefer a more immersive and challenging experience. The game also offers a mode where only your cockpit instruments are displayed. It’s probably a good idea to start off in the standard mode until you get to grips with the controls and gameplay. Lastly, choose your difficulty setting (which will depend on your general experience with flight games), and you’re off to battle.</p><p> Squadrons starts off with an obligatory tutorial mission to teach you how to fly. Though it’s somewhat prolonged, the initial awe of the scenery of an Imperial battlegroup banishes any boredom that you might expect from a tutorial mission. Gliding around Star Destroyers and other classic Star Wars spaceships is quite an experience.</p><p> The story is passable, if not terribly deep or ambitious, and is basically there to connect the battle sequences and give context to the fight. Voice acting varies from mediocre to passable, and there’s clearly some effort put into establishing likeable characters. However, though the character models are good, there’s definitely a bit of the uncanny valley on display here, and it’s particularly noticeable in the first-person conversations where you stare dumbly on as an NPC spouts exposition at you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_MN0adYtaTCJ1Qhmsivk-M-DkXo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-3-31074635684244d48b1d792540a477e2.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918666/19272" target="_top" id="1918666">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918666" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918666/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> In between story missions you are fixed in place in different rooms, where you click on different characters to talk to them. I found these sequences to be very linear and I found that they tended to drag on. I’d certainly have preferred to be able to walk around rather than teleport between locations on the ship. This is probably due to this game being intended to be played in VR where the fixed positioning makes more sense due to the limitations of VR, but the game would’ve been well served by separate control schemes. This is a minor gripe; if desired you can just skip through these sequences pretty quickly.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep"><a href="#Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep"></a><strong>Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep</strong></h2><p> The real meat of the game is in battle, and it’s an incredibly intense and immersive experience. Whatever system or control method you’re utilizing, there are a lot of different inputs and functions to learn. This would be daunting to newcomers, but the campaign does a great job of gradually introducing new controls and mechanics at a pace that makes them easy to pick up.</p><p> One of the most complex aspects of the game is team and system management, which involves making quick decisions about the layout of your ship and the behaviour of your allies. The basic power systems are easy to master, and simple “attack this” and “defend that” commands aren’t hard to learn, but there are more complicated systems as well that add a level of depth to the game for dedicated players.</p><p> Both the empire and rebels have a range of four classes of ships to choose from - a jack-of-all-trades fighter, a slow bomber with a fearsome arsenal of weapons, a fast and agile interceptor, and a support class ship. I really appreciated that the game doesn’t just make these reskinned mechanically identical clones for each faction. Instead, each side has its unique quirks that affect gameplay, and somehow the designers were still able to balance the game so that neither team feels outgunned by the other.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive. There is some of the traditional looping around in circles, but between the obstacles placed about the map, the different capabilities of the various ships, and the interaction between you and your teammates, this happens only occasionally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/COT6eEVvzd6QqCbhmtbP4a_C--Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-6-9d086810906a486b9266ec247e2ab966-3636fb8670644ae98afd0bc57b59df8d.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105883/7443" target="_top" id="2105883">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105883" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105883/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The one thing that pulled me out of the game at times was the somewhat wonky ship physics, which make sense from the pilot’s seat, but look a bit weird to see from other ships. You can stop quickly and turn on a dime, which benefits gameplay on a technical level, but is a bit jarring and unrealistic to witness.</p><p> One important aspect of gameplay is how Squadrons balances the fragility of its fighters with creating a fun experience. It does this using shields and repair kits that vary from ship to ship and which can be customized. It walks the fine line between allowing you to mow down enemy fighters without wailing away at them for ages, while also preventing you from feeling like you’re piloting a glass canon.</p><p> There’s also ship customization, which allows you to alter various aspects of your aircraft such as armament, hull, and engines to enhance various attributes, though this usually comes at a cost to other capabilities. For example, you can trade speed for extra agility and vice versa. It requires a deep understanding of the ship you’re customizing so you’ll probably want to wait to touch this till you’ve had plenty of practice in battle. There are also cosmetic customizations, such as paint jobs and ornaments. Both gameplay and cosmetic customizations are purchased with separate types of in-game currency.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous. Ships are lovingly rendered and great detail was paid to getting the lighting, environments, and effects just right. The cockpits of the different ships you pilot are fully realized and mesmerizing in their realism. It’s easy to get sucked into ogling a grand alien vista or just reveling in the experience of being in the cockpit of an honest to goodness X-Wing. Explosions, lasers, enemy ships tearing apart in fiery gouts of flame, and the realistic damage to your own ship, provoke many tense situations that hit home and are bound to get your heart racing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a-_aXPmbq5vlMG21Sutf0cIe4BI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-7-dc3679df974e4da793c52f2fb2831eac.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The game is less attractive in VR, with muddier textures and blurrier skybox, but the trade-off for added immersion is well worth the sacrifice. Actually moving your head to scan around the glass cockpit for enemy fighters and capital ships (or your own wingmates) and then diving in to engage is some of the most fun you can have in VR.</p><h2 id="Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars"><a href="#Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Authentic Star Wars"></a><strong>Audio: Authentic Star Wars</strong></h2><p> With the vast majority of video games, your experience is almost as dependent on what you hear as what you see. In this regard, Squadrons is a masterpiece. This game perfectly replicates the epic feel of classic Star Wars space combat from the laser fire, to the roar of your engines, to the exhilarating whoosh of grazing an asteroid. There’s also the unforgettable John Williams soundtrack, which is fully present here and is just as vital to the experience of the game as it is to the films.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094414/7443" target="_top" id="2094414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094414/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs"><a href="#Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs"></a><strong>Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs</strong></h2><p> I was able to get consistently high frame rates during gameplay with my custom gaming PC running 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X processor, and an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU. However, I experienced some odd stuttering in the hanger between missions, which seemed more of a graphical bug than an issue with the power of my PC. I also played Squadrons on a laptop with a less powerful processor, 16GB of RAM, and a Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q. The game performed well and provided a smooth gameplay experience at maximum graphical settings.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive.</p><h2 id="Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs"><a href="#Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs" class="headerlink" title="Controls: Wide support for different inputs"></a><strong>Controls: Wide support for different inputs</strong></h2><p> Squadrons offers customizable support for a wide range of different control schemes, from gamepads to HOTAS flight sticks to mouse and keyboard. I had to fiddle with a few settings to get my stick and thrust control up and running, but when I did, it added an extra layer of immersion to the experience. However, mouse and keyboard is clearly the optimal and intended control method for Squadrons.</p><h2 id="Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights"><a href="#Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights"></a><strong>Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights</strong></h2><p> Squadrons features a basic but robust multiplayer mode, the bread and butter of which are team-based dogfights. These are exciting and challenging matches that truly test your skill at the game, and thanks to a decent selection of varied maps it really doesn’t get old.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oKG6kRHcFEOz3O6bwL5_SyeUiEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-4-78947bfe57874d45ae8f401482c3ddf6-379a507c078e44d6898e28d20f53aac9.jpeg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The other mode features massive large scale multi-stage fleet battles, which require careful team coordination to advance across the battlefield and destroy the enemies’ flagship. It’s a good idea to save this for after you’ve played through most of the campaign, learned the controls, and have tried your hand at a few multiplayer dogfights.</p><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a><strong>Price: Good value</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of just $40 Star Wars: Squadrons is a surprisingly reasonably priced game that bucks the trend of modern AAA games uniformly releasing for $60 regardless of what content they are able to offer. It’s not the longest game, and there is a limit to end-game multiplayer content, so $40 is pretty much the exact right price for Squadrons. It’s refreshing to see a distinct lack of any extra monetization in the game, with no annoying microtransactions or loot boxes.</p><h2 id="Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous"><a href="#Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous"></a><strong>Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a deeper, more daunting, complex space sim, Elite Dangerous is the next step. Squadrons is far more exciting, being laser-focused on intense aerial combat. Elite Dangerous is a more methodical game, with a focus on exploration and trading, though there’s also exciting combat there if you want it.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> An exhilarating space combat experience that is particularly well suited to VR.</p><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is a fine successor to classic space combat games, and is an undeniably exciting and realistic experience. It’s best if played with a VR headset, but is worth your time and money on a traditional screen as well. The memory of my first flight at the helm of a TIE Fighter in this game has stuck with me with surprising clarity in a way that few moments in video games do, and it’s something you really have to experience for yourself to understand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1542129">                    <video width="864" height="1152" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1542129">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"                      style="border: none;

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> There’s a lot to love about the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-2-review-5092839" >Oculus Quest 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The standalone, wireless headset is easily the best VR experience for the majority of buyers, packing in solid power, a great screen, and quality games at the fantastic price of $299. But there are a couple of downgrades from the original, pricier Oculus Quest model, and the flimsy strap is chief among them.</p><p> While certainly usable, the Quest 2’s included fabric strap isn’t particularly effective at keeping the headset firmly and comfortably positioned on your face. Luckily, Quest 2 owners have another option if they’re willing to spend extra cash: the official Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap.</p><p> Available on its own for $49 or with a battery pack and carrying case for $129, the Elite Strap is a major improvement and worthwhile pickup for anyone who doesn’t love the original fit. I tested the latter configuration with the integrated battery pack and included case.</p><h2 id="Design-A-more-supportive-strap"><a href="#Design-A-more-supportive-strap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A more supportive strap"></a>Design: A more supportive strap</h2><p> While the standard Oculus Quest 2 strap is simply made up of fabric bands—one around the back of your head and the other over the top—the Elite Strap is mostly plastic and significantly more supportive. That’s because it helps offset the weight of the visor itself by using the back of your head to securely keep the entire headset in place, thus minimizing its ability to sag or feel heavy on your face.</p><p> The Elite Strap does this by having a soft plastic, oval-like brace at the back, which gently presses against the back of your head. It’s supported in part by a single fabric strap on the top, but more crucially by a locking mechanism on the back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/g-QXyXCZitYdlr7F5TWDuzllhuY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_02-83833091dfde4b3b9e2253177901bb66.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Unlike the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-vr-4157636" >PlayStation VR’s strap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example, the Quest 2 Elite Strap’s fit wheel doesn’t lock into place and make you press a button to release it from your head when you want out. Instead, you can gradually adjust it until the headset feels snug but comfortable, and freely tighten or loosen it as needed. It stays put.</p><p> It’s a big upgrade over the normal Quest 2 strap. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-review-4692669" >original Quest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> had a simple plastic strap, but it was a step up from what Oculus shipped with the sequel. The Elite Strap represents an improvement upon both standard designs, and it’s one of the best VR headset straps around. It’s secure, easy to use, and comfortable, checking every box on the list.</p><p> The Elite Strap is a major improvement and worthwhile pickup for anyone who doesn’t love the original strap’s fit.</p><p> This particular Elite Strap model has a battery pack built into the back part of the strap, within the plastic housing. It doesn’t feel heavy or noticeable, although there must be a weight difference between this version and the standalone, battery-less Elite Strap option.</p><p> Meanwhile, the included carrying case in this bundle is large enough to fit the entire headset with the Elite Strap, as well as the two Oculus Touch controllers and the charger. The large pill-shaped design is non-traditional for a gadget case, looking like light grey sweatpants and with a wool-like felt texture. The case can be a little awkward to unzip, but it’s functional and roomy enough to hold everything, even if it doesn’t look nearly as cool as what it holds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Snap-it-on"><a href="#Setup-Process-Snap-it-on" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Snap it on"></a>Setup Process: Snap it on</h2><p> Oculus built in a clever strap support system with the Quest 2 that lets you securely and seamlessly attach different kinds of straps. When you remove the standard strap, you’ll be left with these plastic “wings” on either side of the visor, and those snap right into the Elite Strap’s plastic bands to firmly attach it to the visor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kePEj93uGIlmO7iyZMsHMaUpHEE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_03-4d5ab74d783144e0aee262248d5cdb89.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Once it’s secured, simply plug the USB-C cable on the side of the Elite Strap into the Quest 2 visor, as this adds power from the battery pack into your total supply. Now you’ll charge the entire headset via the USB-C port beneath the dial on the Elite Strap, which provides power to both the visor and strap batteries.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105869/7443" target="_top" id="2105869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Effective-and-adjustable"><a href="#Comfort-Effective-and-adjustable" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Effective and adjustable"></a>Comfort: Effective and adjustable</h2><p> Comfort is one of the driving forces behind the creation of the Elite Strap, and a major reason anyone would consider paying $49 or more for a different strap. Some people might find the Oculus Quest 2’s strap to be perfectly fine, but in my own testing, it was just tolerable: The headset felt heavy and was never as securely fastened in place as I wanted it to be. It was a big step down from the original Quest’s solid, rubberized plastic strap.</p><p> [The strap] helps take away some of the friction that bad straps can create, letting you sink further into the immersive illusion.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap fixes that issue for me, and I can’t imagine anyone will find it to be less comfortable than the standard strap. It’s a clever design that pulls inspiration from previous VR headsets to ably support the weight of the visor, while still allowing for subtle adjustments without needing to take the headset off your dome. It feels great in use, and more importantly, it helps take away some of the friction that bad straps can create, letting you sink further into the immersive illusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v5qFVd_vGEfVkRoTgyxHCnpNO7Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_04-6b671f2308db4225b4f355d0abd12f2d.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557742/17382" target="_top" id="1557742">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557742" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557742/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Battery-Double-the-uptime"><a href="#Battery-Double-the-uptime" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Double the uptime"></a>Battery: Double the uptime</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2’s built-in battery lasts only about two hours, and the Elite Strap’s secondary 4,676mAh pack effectively doubles that tally. It adds roughly two more hours of use, meaning you’ll have the freedom to play for much longer sessions and&#x2F;or charge the headset less often.</p><p> I haven’t personally had any issue with the Quest 2’s modest battery, as I rarely play VR for more than an hour at a time. However, as more immersive games are released, as people use VR for social interactions, and as you might spend more time watching idle content (like movies) in a virtual reality setting, that extra buffer could come in handy. The Quest 2 sips power from the Elite Strap’s battery first, and as previously mentioned, one USB-C plug charges the whole thing.</p><p> The battery pack adds roughly two more hours of use, meaning you’ll have the freedom to play for much longer sessions and&#x2F;or charge the headset less often.</p><p> Granted, there are DIY options out there for boosting the Quest 2’s battery life, including plugging in a portable power bank and either sticking it into your pocket or otherwise affixing it to your body or headset. Depending on the size of the power bank, you could get significantly more uptime from that kind of solution and at a lower cost—but that’s more hassle and it’s a less elegant solution than the official option here.</p><h2 id="Price-Not-cheap-but-it’s-worth-it"><a href="#Price-Not-cheap-but-it’s-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not cheap, but it’s worth it"></a>Price: Not cheap, but it’s worth it</h2><p> After spending $299 on a VR headset, some might bristle at spending another $49 for a different strap—or $129 for that strap, double the battery life, and a case. However, if the Quest 2’s standard strap isn’t meeting your needs, then the Elite Strap is well worth the extra cash.</p><p> It eliminates one of the common pain points of the Quest 2 experience, letting you focus more on the VR experience rather than how you’re accessing it. The Quest 2 is already incredibly well-priced for a standalone VR console, and still feels like a great value even if you factor in another $49 for the Elite Strap.</p><p> Do you need the whole bundle with the battery pack and case, though? If you typically use the Quest 2 in short sessions and don’t mind plugging it in on a regular basis, then probably not. The battery_can_ be a major benefit, particularly if you find yourself sticking around in VR for longer time spans, but that’s not always the case for users. The Elite Strap, in my view, provides the greatest enhancement within this bundle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/edSGh2YZZ5OIkwkHbEJnwtUjfGc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_05-e018715e02944614b51af8a2cb98f055.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> The case is nice to have, and given that the original official Oculus Quest case sold for $40 on its own, this bundle doesn’t feel overpriced by comparison. Buying the Oculus Quest 2 headset plus this bundle comes out to nearly the same price as buying the original Quest headset ($399) plus its carrying case back when, but now you get double the battery life along with the myriad enhancements of the core Quest 2 hardware.</p><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-Elite-Strap-vs-Orzero-Adjustable-Headband-for-Quest-2"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-Elite-Strap-vs-Orzero-Adjustable-Headband-for-Quest-2" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap vs. Orzero Adjustable Headband for Quest 2"></a>Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap vs. Orzero Adjustable Headband for Quest 2</h2><p> There’s a number of third-party straps for the Quest 2 out there, no doubt encouraged by the severe supply shortage of the Elite Strap following its release. Orzero’s Adjustable Headband for Oculus Quest 2 (view at<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MFH6V6C/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5193587%7Cn10531399cf62445bbb649a7878d1155511%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a well-reviewed alternative that’s a bit different in look, thanks to a much larger plastic shell on the back of your head, but it appears to work similarly to the official Elite Strap. It’s $10 cheaper than the official option, so it could be a good substitute or cheaper alternative. There is no version with a built-in battery pack, however.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A truly Elite addition to the Quest 2.</strong></p><p> If your Oculus Quest 2 doesn’t quite fit right, pick up the Elite Strap. It’s a much better-designed strap that securely and comfortably keeps the VR headset in place during use, and is well worth the extra cash. True, you might grimace at the thought of spending more money on something that should’ve come with the standard headset, but the improved experience should ultimately outweigh that frustration. The bundle with the battery pack and carrying case adds further value and is worthwhile if you’re keen on longer play sessions or not needing to charge the headset as often, but the Elite Strap itself is the most essential add-on in this set.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-2-review-5092839" >Oculus Quest 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-rift-review-4690370" >Oculus Rift Headset and Controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-go-vr-headset-review-4690298" >Oculus Go Standalone VR Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery and Carrying Case</li><li>Product Brand  Oculus</li><li>UPC  815820021056</li><li>Price  $129.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2020</li><li>Weight  11.36 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  13 x 6.75 x 4.5 in.</li><li>Color  White&#x2F;Black</li><li>Ports  USB-C</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-beginners-pathway-to-grasping-hd-content-standards-for-2024/"><u>[New] Beginner’s Pathway to Grasping HD Content Standards for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-free-online-youtube-mp3-converters/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Free Online YouTube-MP3 Converters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-influencer-innovation-the-top-5-instagram-tactics-for-maximum-impact/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Influencer Innovation The Top 5 Instagram Tactics for Maximum Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-google-meet-aesthetics-elevating-with-filters-and-effects/"><u>[Updated] Google Meet Aesthetics Elevating with Filters and Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-seamless-integration-of-youtube-melodies-into-imovie/"><u>[Updated] Seamless Integration of YouTube Melodies Into iMovie</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-transfer-music-from-oneplus-nord-ce-3-lite-5g-to-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>4 Ways to Transfer Music from OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G to iPhone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-navigating-the-features-of-a-9-lenovo-tablet/"><u>Comprehensive Guide: Navigating the Features of a 9 Lenovo Tablet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/download-the-magicard-rio-pro-driver-compatible-with-windows-10817-get-it-now/"><u>Download the Magicard Rio Pro Driver - Compatible with Windows 10/8.1/7: Get It Now!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/head-to-head-battle-features-and-performance-of-the-iphone-1e-plus-vs-the-pro-max/"><u>Head-to-Head Battle: Features and Performance of the iPhone 1E Plus Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus is an interesting proposition. For only $50, it promises to provide heart rate monitoring, music storage, call management, voice control, and remote notifications. For the most part, it delivers. The Bitwatch has its share of design flaws, such as a poorly fitted watch strap and an iOS-only voice app, but it performs enough to be a reasonable consideration for those looking for their first smartwatch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8rMhc1Lk5yFRFW4Zlt2K9cmPdFo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-4-01d7e5ff51aa47008d803513064f4a7a.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-and-Software-A-surprising-amount-of-features-in-this-chunky-watch"><a href="#Design-and-Software-A-surprising-amount-of-features-in-this-chunky-watch" class="headerlink" title="Design and Software: A surprising amount of features in this chunky watch"></a><strong>Design and Software: A surprising amount of features in this chunky watch</strong></h2><p> The most outstanding feature of the Bitwatch’s design is its chunkiness. For those with small wrists, this smartwatch looks ridiculous. Furthermore, the included bands are too small in comparison to the watch, giving the overall design a cheap feel. When you wear this watch, you will notice it weighing your wrists down, taunting you to take it off. But as ugly as the Bitwatch is, it is a functional little watch. It has a power button and volume buttons, as well as a strong vibration motor. Its touchscreen works without a problem, and the app layout is intuitive to understand.</p><p> The 2-inch IPS panel is bright and easy to read, although not the highest resolution (240 x 240). When you scroll through the Bitwatch’s apps, it’s apparent that it heavily favors Apple devices: there is a Siri app integration, but this will not work with Android devices. Its other apps are a phonebook, call log, dialer, messaging, remote notifier, “anti-theft” (Find My Phone), alarm, calendar, music storage and playback, remote capture, pedometer, sleep monitor, sedentary reminder, heart rate monitor, sound recorder, stopwatch, and calculator. It’s a fairly thorough collection of applications for a watch that doesn’t support third-party apps.</p><p> The 2-inch IPS panel is bright and easy to read, although not the highest resolution (240 x 240).</p><p> While it doesn’t have<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nfc-832715" >NFC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or GPS, it does have a speaker, and you can send basic messages with the watch. The Bitwatch S1 is surprisingly robust for those who want to dip their toes into the smartwatch experience, with many of the features that mid-tier smartwatches possess.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-but-unexplained"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-but-unexplained" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy, but unexplained"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy, but unexplained</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Bitwatch works as you’d expect. Pair it via the Bluetooth on your phone and download the Beantech app. It works with both Android and iOS, so you should have no difficulty. Alerts will show up in the remote notifier app, and apps such as the calendar are not synced with your phone’s calendar apps, so keep that in mind if you’d like to add any events, notifications, or alarms to your watch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O7xHfA9sKsBdC0nmqNXbFky-Dm4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-2-3b838f1124184bbd9452b79bb8449c2b.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135417/19272" target="_top" id="2135417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135417/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Performance-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Performance-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Performance: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Performance: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> The Bitwatch’s low price tag shows in its performance, unfortunately. The Siri app is just that: it interfaces with Siri, meaning that voice commands are iOS-exclusive. Notification handling on the device can get confusing also. You find notifications in the Remote Notifier app, and dismissing them on the Bitwatch does not dismiss them on your phone.</p><p> You get reliable notifications and a passable heart rate monitor, as well as some basic functions like alarms and a speaker.</p><p> However, notifications do sync almost instantly from your phone to the Bitwatch, and its heart rate monitor is fairly accurate when measuring a resting heart rate. The pedometer isn’t the best thought, often falling within a range of a hundred steps of the true value.</p><p> If you’d like to listen to calls or music through the speaker, you will miss a lot of information— think of those jingles they play when you’re on hold for a phone call. At least the screen is big and easy to read, and the notifications_do_ work. It’s good enough for someone that wants to get a feel to a smartwatch experience, but there are better options for a little more money if you can afford it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7GtX2IU-w4sJA-BTqQtHQThxaJo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-3-ade31135cd9d4fe0b6b01286941d2652.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Battery-It-last-longer-than-most-flagship-smartwatches"><a href="#Battery-It-last-longer-than-most-flagship-smartwatches" class="headerlink" title="Battery: It last longer than most flagship smartwatches"></a><strong>Battery: It last longer than most flagship smartwatches</strong></h2><p> The battery life on the Bitwatch is excellent. With regular usage (GPS, heart rate, Bluetooth all on), we got between two and three days of use before we had to recharge. Charging is a little annoying, though, since it uses a snapping charger base that’s difficult to remove.</p><h2 id="Price-Reasonable-but-worth-paying-more"><a href="#Price-Reasonable-but-worth-paying-more" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable, but worth paying more"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable, but worth paying more</strong></h2><p> The Bitwatch costs about $50, which is reasonable for its features and performance. You get reliable notifications and a passable heart rate monitor, as well as some basic functions like alarms and a speaker. If you want a cheap smartwatch, then the Bitwatch isn’t a bad pick, but $30 more can get you GPS and smarter notifications.

However, it suffers in reliability and style, which may turn users off from the smartwatch market altogether. For a little more money, you can get the Amazfit Bip_,_ a sleek smartwatch from Huami that has a thirty-day battery life, fitness tracking, onboard GPS, and notifications. If you’re looking to get something very cheap to try out the smartwatch lifestyle, you should also look at the Padgene DZ09 Smart Watch, which is only $15 and has a lot of the features on the Bitwatch.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazfit-bip-review-4773112" >Amazfit Bip Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An ultra-budget smartwatch that covers the basics.</strong></p><p> The Beantech Bitwatch is not a groundbreaking smartwatch, but it provides a lot of essential features for $50. If you’re looking to try out smartwatches, the Bitwatch will give you a solid battery life, music storage, passive notifications, phone call management, and a very large touchscreen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130869/7443" target="_top" id="2130869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Bitwatch S1 Plus</li><li>Product Brand  Beantech</li><li>MPN  B071VZMBH9</li><li>Price  $59.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.97 x 1.61 x 0.54 in.</li><li>Compatibility  iOS, Android</li><li>Platform  Bitwatch App</li><li>Storage  8GB</li><li>Camera  Yes</li><li>Battery Capacity  Unknown;

The ASUS BW-16D1X-U measures 2.48 x 6.50 x 9.57 inches, making it a bit of a desk hog, but with that extra size, you get serious performance for every task.</p><p> The ASUS BW-16D1X-U has fast access times on all types of optical media, so you’ll spend less time waiting around. It can access CD-ROM at 160ms, DVD-ROM at 170ms, and BD-ROM at 180ms. Its read and write performance is also stellar, with 40x, 16x, and 8x read speeds in CD, DVD, and Blu-ray, respectively. Likewise, it can burn CD-R at 40x, DVD-R at 16x, and BD-R at 16x.</p><p> So, whether you want to rip media from discs or burn data to them, the Asus BW-16D1X-U can do the job quickly.

Write speeds are also decent, with up to 24x on CD-R and up to 8x on DVD-R.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 needs a single USB connection for all its power and data transfer needs. Further rounding out the package, the LG GP65NB60 supports Windows and Mac, can burn archival-quality M-Disc, and comes in various colors, with black, gold, white, and silver on offer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139110/17108" target="_top" id="2139110">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139110" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139110/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Most-Compact"><a href="#Most-Compact" class="headerlink" title="Most Compact"></a>Most Compact</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >Verbatim External Slimline Blu-ray Writer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BO4kmGezMrCvhvw2CCVi4n592BU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/verbatim-external-cd-dvd-blu-ray-writer-usb-30-m-disc-ready---movie-playback-requires-playback-software-not-included-67c2a99c85c4425298b176462124e43b.jpg" >Verbatim External CD DVD Blu-ray Writer USB 3.0 M-Disc Ready - Movie playback requires playback software (not included) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >$126 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid metal case</li><li>M-Disc support</li><li>Comes with USB Type-C adapter</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Doesn’t include software</li><li>Isn’t cheap</li><li>Fragile tray</li></ul><p> Many modern laptops forgo an optical drive to trim their size and weight.

External optical drives allow you to store massive amounts of data, including photos, videos, and software from CDs and DVDs, with easy access whenever and wherever you need it.</p><p> With hundreds of external optical drives on the market, finding the right one may take a lot of work. However, we’ve narrowed our top selections to the top four. We evaluated using five criteria: connectivity, compatibility, read&#x2F;write speeds, portability, and optional features such as low power consumption and M-Disc support.</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p><p> Our preferred external optical drive supports USB 3.0 or higher for faster data transfer speeds. It should also be compatible with Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android OS, and FireOS, which is preferable for users with multiple devices running different file types of all sizes.</p><p> Almost all external optical drives have a micro USB port, although the larger mini USB can save more files.</p><p> Other areas to consider with connectivity include BDXL support, which allows you to store all your files on a 128GB disc.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> In addition to supporting standard CDs and DVDs, bolster your data processing power by choosing models with Blu-ray disc support. Ensure your preferred format is supported to avoid any returns due to compatibility issues.</p><p> If you store a lot of precious digital data, like family photos, you may want to explore external optical drives offering M-Disc support. These drives promise to last 1,000 years versus 7-10 years for standard DVDs before losing image quality.</p><p><strong>Read&#x2F;Write Speeds</strong></p><p> In short, the faster the read and write speeds, the quicker it will take to transfer large files or burn discs. Read speeds indicate how long it takes to open files, while write speeds indicate how long it takes to save data. At a minimum, look for read and write speeds of 40x (CDs), 16x (DVDs), and 16x (Blu-ray), although the higher, the better. No wonder why our Best Overall pick is the ASUS BW-16D1X-U Blu-ray Drive with read speeds of 8x (Blu-ray), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD) versus write speeds of 16x (BD-R), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD).</p><p><strong>Portability</strong></p><p> If you’re constantly on the go, we highly recommend a slim and lightweight design that is easy to carry around. One perfect example is the LG GP65NB60 External Drive, which is only 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches. It should be small enough to fit in a laptop bag, person, or backpack. Plus, many of them come with integrated cables, which keep your bags clutter-free and cord-free.</p><p><strong>Optional Features</strong></p><p> Other areas to consider when choosing an external optical drive are its durability and build quality. Check for ones with anti-scratch coatings, shock resistance, and sturdy construction to withstand wear and tear, especially when traveling, as they constantly get knocked in your luggage.</p><p> On the usability side, you may also enjoy external optical drives with silent operation and low power consumption, which offer a more comfortable working environment.</p><p> Kudos for any external optical drive with M-Disc support, as well as bundled backup software or free subscriptions to cloud services that offer even more robust backups.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cd-players-and-changers-1846562" >The Best CD Players and CD Changers of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What are the advantages of an optical drive?<br> With media increasingly moving to digital rather than physical storage solutions, an optical drive may seem outdated. But there are still many reasons to invest in an optical drive, not the least of which is to access older media, a significant percentage of which still hasn’t been shifted to a digital&#x2F;online solution. This is especially true if you have games, videos, photos, or documents backed up on physical media. Optical drives can also be a handy way to create new backups quickly and inexpensively, and some programs require discs for emergency boot tools.</li><li>Can you read a DVD in a Blu-Ray drive?<br> Yes, both CDs and DVDs are compatible with Blu-Ray drives, and there are combo drives that can burn discs of all three types as well. By contrast, DVD drives cannot read Blu-Ray media.</li><li>How does an optical drive work?<br> Optical drives read and write data to discs using a laser. The laser creates pits in an organic dye layer on the disc’s surface to write, the reflected light from which can then be read by photodiodes in the drive and converted back into the original data. The disc spins, allowing the laser to read the tracks on its surface consecutively.

As someone with joint issues, I’ve found the console molds perfectly in my hands, even over many hours.</p><p> It has a smaller screen than the standard Nintendo Switch, but games continue to run in 720p, so it still looks pretty good. There’s no performance drop here—just a more petite build.</p><p> I played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and it was still excellent fun and immersive. Exploring the console is straightforward and clearly laid out, so newcomers and children can quickly figure out what to do.</p><p> Games can be bought digitally or as physical cartridges. The console has 32GB of internal storage, which can always be upgraded with a microSD card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TmYyOgzBYexzwHM_D35w2XJF68c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NintendoSwitchLite1-33b6996f36534d1da9974a460e6c5139.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite gaming console."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> That’s not to say that concessions aren’t made here. The Nintendo Switch Lite can’t be docked like its bigger sibling, missing out on one of the reasons why it’s called a Switch.</p><p> Because of that, the Joy-Con controllers can’t be detached, so you’ll need to buy a separate controller to attempt to play multiplayer on the small screen.</p><p> Also, the lack of unattached Joy-Con controllers means no motion controls, which can affect many games.</p><p> Despite that, the Nintendo Switch Lite is an ideal entry point to gaming as it’s so easy to use.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, Digital Trends, GamesRadar, and Wirecutter all recommend the Nintendo Switch Lite.

During my time with them, I spent dozens of hours comparing them.</p><p> That included seeing how quickly each console loaded and allowed me to immediately play a game and how simple it was to do so.</p><p> I also looked at the number of games available for each system, any advantages they offer, and whether the controller felt comfortable and intuitive to use.</p><p> I also considered possibly the most critical factor – how much fun it was to play on each console, which made me want to return for more.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p> What to Look For</p><p> Buying a games console is never a cheap proposition, so buying the right one for you and your needs is essential, rather than making a mistake.</p><p> To help you figure out which game console is best for you, consider these key things before you buy:</p><p><strong>Who’s playing?</strong></p><p> All game consoles have a variety of games aimed at different age groups, but some are better for certain players than others.</p><p> For instance, PlayStation has many hard-hitting single-player experiences with stories exploring adult themes. It may also have games like Bluey and the Lego titles, but its strength is in more adult titles.</p><p> Alternatively, the Nintendo Switch has the Mario franchise, which is very family-friendly. Many couch co-op and multiplayer titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, offer a more sociable experience.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> Do you already own a console? That can affect what your next one should be.</p><p> Almost all Xbox One accessories work with the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, so if you already have some controllers or a headset, it makes sense to stick with the same ecosystem.</p><p> Also, if you have digital or physical copies of games, it’s worth checking if you can still play those on the new console.</p><p> The PS5 plays PS4 games, and the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S plays Xbox One games; however, the Switch isn’t backward compatible with the Nintendo Wii U.</p><p><strong>Convenience</strong></p><p> Some consoles are more portable than others. Something like the Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 will live under your TV or next to your monitor and can’t easily be transported elsewhere.</p><p> The Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck work portably and are docked to a screen. It’s worth considering how important portability is for you. Generally, consoles that solely work via a TV or monitor tend to be more powerful, but you miss out on quickly taking it out with you.</p><p> The newest gaming consoles can be pricey, but you don’t have to spend much for an exciting gaming experience. For instance, Nintendo’s consoles, on average, cost about $100 less than many of its competitors. You can also find great deals on classic systems.</p><p> If you’ve previously owned a gaming console, you should consider buying a new one compatible with the library of games you’ve likely collected.</p><p> For example, newer PlayStations won’t play games from older Sony consoles, but you can still access hundreds of older PlayStation titles using the PS Now streaming service.</p><p> On the other hand, Xbox consoles have much better backward compatibility, not to mention a digital redemption scheme that lets you download newer versions of your existing games for free.</p><p> How important is it to you to be able to play your favorite games in true 4K? If your answer is “very,” you’ll want a console that supports 2160p or higher, but if your answer is “not really,” you can settle for something else. The same goes for virtual reality, as not all systems will support it.  </p><p> For more advice,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/before-you-buy-gaming-console-8654423" >read our gaming console buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Other-Consoles-We-Considered"><a href="#Other-Consoles-We-Considered" class="headerlink" title="Other Consoles We Considered"></a>Other Consoles We Considered</h2><ul><li>The<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-Mario-Red/dp/B09NCMZNJK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4154610%7Cn581a2dc3ff9d4e12aa7563f93e0778da14%7C" >Nintendo Switch OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the ultimate Nintendo Switch.

However, not connecting your console will severely hamper its features and your overall enjoyment. Besides being unable to play with your friends online, you won’t get updates for your console or games, purchase or download games digitally, or access the multitudes of free games that typically become available over a console’s lifetime.</li><li>Can you upgrade your consoles?<br> Modern consoles have a limited upgrade capacity, usually restricted to storage and aesthetics. Unfortunately, there is no way to install granular upgrades like you would see with a gaming PC, but you still have the option to increase your storage space or swap its color for something more palatable.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/n-2024-incorporating-yt-playlists-into-web-design/"><u>[New] In 2024, Incorporating YT Playlists Into Web Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-pioneering-your-path-to-viral-content-exquisite-templates-for-tiktok-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Pioneering Your Path to Viral Content Exquisite Templates for TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-techcapture-pro-a-comprehensive-2023-study/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, TechCapture Pro A Comprehensive 2023 Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-youtube-google-meet-live-broadcast-steps/"><u>[Updated] Mastering YouTube Google Meet Live Broadcast Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-drone-propellers-selecting-prime-quadcopter-engines/"><u>2024 Approved Top Drone Propellers Selecting Prime Quadcopter Engines</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/5-outstanding-software-choices-over-microsoft-office/"><u>5 Outstanding Software Choices Over Microsoft Office</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/accelerate-your-auto-enthusiasm-a-guide-to-new-age-automotive-engineering-reads-and-blogs-for-fans-in-chicago-book-five-of-fourth-series/"><u>Accelerate Your Auto Enthusiasm – A Guide to New-Age Automotive Engineering Reads & Blogs for Fans in Chicago, Book Five of Fourth Series!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-connectivity-on-wheels-unveiling-the-bouncie-driving-link-the-easy-guide-to-your-journey-tracking-system/"><u>Affordable Connectivity on Wheels: Unveiling the Bouncie Driving Link - The Easy Guide to Your Journey Tracking System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-flight-beginnings-with-the-syma-x5c-rc-quadcopter-a-detailed-review/"><u>Affordable Flight Beginnings with the SYMA X5C RC Quadcopter: A Detailed Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-high-definition-viewing-experience-with-the-hisense-50-4k-hdr-television/"><u>Affordable High-Definition Viewing Experience with the Hisense 50 4K HDR Television</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/an-in-depth-analysis-of-hero7-black-for-extreme-enthusiasts/"><u>An In-Depth Analysis of HERO7 Black for Extreme Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/enhance-your-pc-experience-no-more-hell-let-loose-game-crashes-here/"><u>Enhance Your PC Experience - No More Hell Let Loose Game Crashes Here!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/24-the-definitive-guide-to-youtubes-algorithmic-secrets-for-rankings/"><u>In 2024, The Definitive Guide to YouTube's Algorithmic Secrets for Rankings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/1722686223699-revamping-an-iconic-series-the-fresh-take-on-ratchet-and-clank/"><u>Revamping an Iconic Series: The Fresh Take on Ratchet & Clank</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/simple-solutions-to-resolve-stuttering-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/"><u>Simple Solutions to Resolve Stuttering in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you can’t accommodate or don’t want a really large television, the TCL 50-inch Roku TV offers a decent middle ground that will appeal to shoppers who want an apartment or dorm-friendly TV without sacrificing quality.</p><p> In appearance, the TCL 50S425 doesn’t reinvent the wheel. It’s black, rectangular, and slim. It comes with the option of wall-mounting or setting it up on a media console or other surface with the enclosed stand. With the legs attached, the set measures 44 inches wide, 28 inches tall, and 8 inches deep and weighs only 23.6 pounds. While the screen is categorized in the 50-inch class the size of the display is 49.5 inches on a diagonal. This lack of bulky bezels surrounding the screen contributes to the slim profile of this TV.</p><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV.</p><p> The Roku remote complements the streamlined design of the screen. In the style of other Roku remotes, it’s a compact and almost weightless wand-like infrared device with a simple and straightforward layout. We found it easy to hold in one hand and easily access all 20 buttons without having to make any grip adjustments. There are also a handful of shortcut buttons for quick access to Netflix, Hulu, the Roku Channel, and ESPN. As long as you point it directly toward the TV, you shouldn’t have any problems with remote performance, but we did notice an occasional lag here or there when the remote seemed to hang and then perform multiple actions in quick succession.</p><p> There are some unfortunate design quirks. The remote’s directional buttons are quite loud. They don’t require a hard press to activate, but they make an audible clicking sound. This is slightly jarring since the other buttons are nearly silent when pressed. Another drawback is the LED status indicator located in the bottom center of the display. By default this light is always on. You can turn this indicator off, but it will continue to blink and flash during other operations, which we sometimes found distracting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cT13RJhaMjC05v7eMym3vtM8M0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_05-70fc23cf6c2b4a13ac9d46f9372010ef.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557746/17382" target="_top" id="1557746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557746/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Up and running in minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Up and running in minutes</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 50-inch TCL Roku TV is a breeze. We opted to forego mounting the television, but the user manual indicates that this model is compatible with a VESA 200 x 200 wall mount with M6 x 12mm screws.</p><p> As directed, we placed the monitor face down on a plush surface and attached the two stand legs using the four MS x 25mm screws. After situating the television on a shelf, we plugged the unit into a wall outlet using the enclosed AC power cord. Once the TV was plugged in, it powered on immediately and displayed the guided setup process. These steps were very straightforward and included first setting a language preference, a network connection, and activating the device. The other critical step with setup involves either signing up for or logging into an existing Roku account.</p><p> Since we already had a Roku account, all of our previously selected channels and apps downloaded to the TV, which just took a few minutes, and then we were free to begin exploring. The amount of additional setup is pretty minimal. By default, you’ll see an HDR notification when you’re viewing HDR-enabled content, but you can turn this off from the settings panel if you like.</p><p> Additionally, if you plan to use a set-top cable box or antenna, the user manual offers straightforward instructions for doing so. You also have the option of enabling the Smart TV experience when you use antenna TV mode. This setting uses automatic content recognition (ACR) to make viewing recommendations based on what you view through your antenna or connected HDMI devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884017/19272" target="_top" id="1884017">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884017" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884017/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking</strong></h2><p> One of the biggest draws of a 4K TV is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which offers four times the resolution quality of a standard high definition TV. This pixel resolution is also commonly referred to as Ultra HD (UHD). This Roku TV also comes with HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which is commonly bundled with 4K resolution in the newest smart TVs.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR improves image quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by intensifying the contrast between white and black areas on the screen while achieving a solid balance, so nothing looks too dark or too bright. It also broadens the palette of available colors, especially in combination with Wide Color Gamut (WCG).</p><p> One thing we noticed right out of the gate is how vivid 4K content looks. To test the 4K image quality, we started by exploring the 4K Spotlight content. This section includes links to 4K movies, TV, and videos. We found a couple of nature-themed 4K videos on YouTube and were really impressed with what we saw. A video touring Zion National Park looked almost 3D and we practically felt like we were there. The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> Apart from 4K nature videos, we also browsed 4K movies and TV shows through the Amazon Prime app. We found the same appealing mix of crisp picture quality, vibrant colors, and contrast. Even standard high definition shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, and Prime looked quite good on screen. Though it’s hard to say if there’s a considerable difference, TCL is eager to boast about the power of their 4K Creative Pro upscaling feature which renders regular HD content into 4K-like quality. The bottom line is that HD content looks great across the board, upscaled or not.</p><p> The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> With the handy multi-purpose asterisk button you can alter a number of display settings, and you can access this options menu in the middle of viewing content. Adjusting picture settings doesn’t require exiting an app or pausing whatever you’re watching, which lets you make adjustments and immediately see the result. You can add more vibrancy and contrast to whatever you’re watching, or enable modes like Movie when you’re viewing a film in the evening or with the lights dimmed.</p><p> You can control everything from backlighting to brightness, contrast, and dynamic contrast. This last setting is particularly relevant to HDR content because it helps balance the light and dark settings on your screen so that there’s no excess in either direction. The online user manual does a fine job of explaining some of the advanced picture settings, and even just toggling through the menu on the TV brings up a description of what you’re changing.</p><p> Regular picture mode and the predefined 4K HDR picture settings were on point, which made viewing right out of the box extremely easy and pleasant. We were also pleased by the picture quality from all angles. Getting too close or too far out to the right or left did reveal some shadows and distortion, but only at fairly extreme angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Lv4B9e6LaJSHW7NSl-Braa2vnmc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_03-b8155781e440420aa0c6c2bf19f9fe6a.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934288/19272" target="_top" id="1934288">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934288" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934288/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding</strong></h2><p> While the TCL Roku TV offers impressive picture quality, the sound is less noteworthy. The two built-in 8-watt speakers offer decent volume levels, but there’s no advanced audio settings menu in this model. You do have control over aspects like sound mode and volume mode. The default sound mode is “normal,” which is appropriate for everyday viewing. But you can also select options for higher treble, more bass, movie, or music mode. As for volume modes, you can either turn on leveling, to balance the contrast between lows and highs in audio, or enable night mode, which sets a threshold for how high the volume can go.</p><p> We did notice some issues with what sounded like crackling and extreme lows and highs in dialog and music, though we were able to smooth these issues out by tweaking a few settings.</p><p> In our testing experience in a small room, the internal speakers were more than adequate without the need for additional speakers. If you do want another layer of dimension to your audio, you might consider opting for the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-speakers-and-home-theater-1846770" >wireless speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> designed specifically for Roku TV sets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oA3AbTZysdVWZbOWuuVGOa56_8c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_02-04183ae8dcd44b778b4da0e7706d5df2.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141687/17094" target="_top" id="2141687">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141687" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141687/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006960/19272" target="_top" id="2006960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive and streamlined"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive and streamlined</strong></h2><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV and a big part of the equation is the operating system. The TCL 50S425 operates on Roku OS 9.1, and it’s extremely user-friendly. Updates are automatic so there’s no manual effort required on your part, and the interface is laid out in a clear and uncomplicated manner.</p><p> The Home screen features all of your apps, which you can arrange and delete with the click of the asterisk button. All the other menus are easy to identify as well. There’s a search page, a streaming channels section, and the settings menu. This clean and straightforward layout may not be the most sophisticated, but it’s easy to use and simplicity is the beauty of this system.</p><p> While the remote doesn’t come with a built-in speaker, the free Roku app does offer a voice-assistant feature. It’s best when completing a general search for a show or actor or for launching a particular app. If you have a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa enabled device, this Roku TV will support them, and they offer a generally better experience than using the Roku app voice remote function.</p><h2 id="Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great bargain on a budget"></a><strong>Price: A great bargain on a budget</strong></h2><p> If you don’t want to spend a fortune on a 4K TV, but you want to get as much value as possible, the TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a compelling option. It retails for $350, which situates it in the growing and competitive class of 4K TVs under $500. In the TCL 4-Series alone you have several other models to consider that all share the same specifications except for size. The larger 55-inch TCL Roku TV retails for just $30 more than the 50-inch version and features a larger screen size of 54.6 inches. It may not seem considerable, but if you’re limited with space, the extra width and height (five and two inches, respectively) can actually feel like a pretty massive difference. And if you opt for a smaller display and a lower price tag, the 43-inch TCL Roku TV retails for about $280, but you’re sacrificing 7 inches of display.</p><h2 id="TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition"><a href="#TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition" class="headerlink" title="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"></a><strong>TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</strong></h2><p> The TCL 50-inch Roku TV is not without external competitors either. The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition retails for about $100 more and runs on the Fire OS, which stands toe-to-toe with the Roku platform with access to over 500,000 shows and movies. The Toshiba Fire TV comes with an Alexa-enabled remote, an edge for shoppers who want the ease of a voice assistant built right into the remote. But the Roku TV supports both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as voice control through the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> While the Toshiba TV is in the 55-inch class, the screen size is actually the same as the Roku TV. The former, however is visibly taller, wider, and bulkier. The Toshiba Fire TV does havea slight advantage when it comes to audio quality. The sound can get quite loud and full-bodied, thanks to two 10-watt speakers and DTS Studio Sound&#x2F;DTS TruSurround. On the other hand, the picture quality may not be as impressive as the Roku TV, which really doesn’t require a lot of tweaking to enjoy.

You may find better 4K picture and audio quality in a higher-end model, but this TV offers a welcome smart TV upgrade at a price that won’t empty your pockets.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-xbr49x900f-49-inch-4k-ultra-hd-smart-led-tv-review-4796665" >Sony XBR49X900F 49-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/insignia-ns-43df710na19-fire-tv-edition-review-4770716" >Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lg-27ud58-b27-inch-4k-uhd-ips-monitor-review-4778916" >LG 27UD58-B 27-Inch 4K UHD IPS Monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  50S425 50-inch 4K Smart LED Roku TV</li><li>Product Brand  TCL</li><li>MPN  50S425</li><li>Price  $349.99</li><li>Weight  23.6 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  44.1 x 28 x 8 in.</li><li>Screen Size  49.5 inches</li><li>Platform  Roku OS</li><li>Screen Resolution  3840 x 2160 pixels</li><li>Ports  HDMI x3, USB, Headphone, Digital Audio Optical, RF, Ethernet</li><li>Formats  HD, 4K UHD, HDR10</li><li>Speakers  Two 8-watt</li><li>Connectivity Options  Wi-Fi, Ethernet</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-fb-live-guide-audiences/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, FB Live Guide Audiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-mirrorless-4k-cameras-top-10-list-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] Mirrorless 4K Cameras Top 10 List Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/10-good-places-to-find-music-for-podcast-intro/"><u>10 Good Places to Find Music for Podcast Intro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-excellence-in-depth-zte-blade-a3y-smartphone-evaluation/"><u>Affordable Excellence: In-Depth ZTE Blade A3Y Smartphone Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-lightweight-ultrabook-microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review/"><u>Affordable, Lightweight Ultrabook - Microsoft Surface Laptop Go Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/apex-automotive-code-deciphering-experts-2024-tale/"><u>Apex Automotive Code Deciphering Experts - 2024 Tale</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-the-lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-stellar-performance-as-a-tablet-and-laptop-combo/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of the Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable: Stellar Performance as a Tablet and Laptop Combo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-kootek-laptop-cooling-pad-top-selection-reviewed-here/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad – Top Selection Reviewed Here!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-of-the-moto-g-power-balancing-high-performance-with-extraordinary-battery-life/"><u>Comprehensive Review of the Moto G Power: Balancing High Performance with Extraordinary Battery Life</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/crafty-counterfeits-how-to-find-fake-engagements/"><u>Crafty Counterfeits How to Find Fake Engagements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/dash-by-wonder-workshop-ready-to-roll-into-action-and-ignite-curiosity/"><u>Dash by Wonder Workshop - Ready to Roll Into Action and Ignite Curiosity!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/1722687756198-define-objectives-and-research-questions/"><u>Define Objectives and Research Questions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/detailed-review-iphone-vs-samsung-smartphone-selecting-the-perfect-device-for-you/"><u>Detailed Review: IPhone Vs.

ZMI’s PowerPack 20000 is one of the best all-around options on the market today, providing a sizable cell with speedy charging across phones, tablets, laptops, portable game systems, and more, plus a slim design and great price.</p><p> I tested ZMI’s PowerPack 20000 time and again over more than a week across multiple devices, measuring the charging speeds and comparing it to other similar power banks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jITowxAWHBUo5WF3Y-XI6lKQNQE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/zmi-05-02d76c869b864ef0abddfe824cfbf53a.jpg"                      alt="ZMI PowerPack 20000"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Small-but-powerful"><a href="#Design-Small-but-powerful" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but powerful"></a><strong>Design: Small but powerful</strong></h2><p> The ZMI PowerPack 20000’s size is easily one of its biggest selling points. While it is a little heavy at 14.3 ounces, this power bank is the approximate width and height of a large smartphone, measuring up very closely to the size of my Apple iPhone 11 Pro at 6.3 x 3.2 inches (HWD). Of course, the 0.8-inch thickness is quite a bit larger than any phone today, but unlike most laptop-friendly charging banks, ZMI’s can still fit into a pocket or handbag with ease.</p><p> It’s smooth navy blue aluminum on the outside with a black plastic strip running along the entire frame, with one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Power Delivery 2.0 port and two USB-A ports on one end. Nearby on the upper right side frame is a power button and four small lights that indicate how much power the bank is currently holding.</p><p> Unlike most laptop-friendly charging banks, ZMI’s can still fit into a pocket or handbag with ease.</p><p> The button also serves another very handy purpose: press it twice in a row and you’ll enable USB devices to be used by a connected computer. I plugged the ZMI PowerPack 20000 into a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/huawei-matebook-x-pro-signature-edition-review-4845244" >Huawei MateBook X Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> laptop and then plugged a USB mouse into the power bank, pressed the button twice, and then was able to use the mouse on the laptop. That’s incredibly helpful for slim, premium laptops that have very few ports.</p><p> This power bank doesn’t have an AC port for full-sized power plugs, as some competing power banks do, but it also costs less and is much smaller than those alternatives typically are.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vaINPELrwcWnOZDsX1ztKkCouww=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/zmi-03-1530f666df824f6281040c2ae3285eb2-2e7956941b91403aa888795a7e5e2e33.jpeg"                      alt="ZMI PowerPack 20000"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118305/7443" target="_top" id="2118305">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118305" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118305/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-does-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-does-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy does it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy does it</strong></h2><p> There’s not much to the setup process here. Using the included USB-C to USB-C cable, simply plug one end into the power bank and the other into an AC adapter that you have handy—like one for a laptop, tablet, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Once the four lights on the side are fully illuminated, then the battery pack is fully charged. Simply plug in devices using their respective cables to charge them using the power within the ZMI PowerPack 20000.</p><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-It-keeps-going"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-It-keeps-going" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: It keeps going"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: It keeps going</strong></h2><p> The ZMI PowerPack 20000 has a hearty 20,000mAh cell within, and it charged my devices quickly without fully depleting the brick. I charged a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2019-review-4770116" >2019 MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (13-inch) laptop from 0 percent to 100 percent in just 1 hour, 53 minutes using the ZMI PowerPack 20000’s USB-C PD port, with an effective charging rate of 42.92W (14.8Vx2.9A). When the charging process was complete, the PowerPack still had one light illuminated, indicating that there was still a little bit of battery life remaining.</p><p> In a separate test, I had the ZMI PowerPack 20000 power the MacBook Pro as it played a locally-downloaded movie on loop at full brightness. With the PowerPack plugged in, the laptop maintained its 100 percent charge for 8 hours, 4 minutes before the power bank ran out of juice.</p><p> The PowerPack 20000 also charged a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-4685690" >Samsung Galaxy S10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone from nothing to 100 percent in 1 hour, 47 minutes using the USB-C PD port, with four lights still remaining on the power bank.

Those are both stellar benefits, plus the fabric-lined exterior gives it a distinctive allure. That said, Mophie’s pack sells for $200, and we’d only recommend it if you must have the AC power outlet for charging a power-hungry laptop. If the ZMI PowerPack 20000 will meet your charging needs, however, it’s a much better bargain.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fantastic portable laptop battery charger for nearly everyone.</strong></p><p> It’s honestly difficult to find anything to complain about with the ZMI PowerPack 20000. It’s powerful and does a great job of charging laptops and phones, it has enough capacity to handle those tasks with ease, it’s compact and well-designed, and the price is fantastic. It’s half the size of the giant Anker power brick that I’ve brought on my last two international trips and can handle all of the same tasks. In other words,<em>this</em> is the power brick I’m bringing on my next trip.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  PowerPack 20000</li><li>Product Brand  ZMI</li><li>SKU  X001ESM8MV</li><li>Price  $70.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.3 x 3.2 x 0.8 in.</li><li>Warranty  18 months</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C, 2x USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlock-the-potential-of-photography-with-adobe-motion-blur/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlock the Potential of Photography with Adobe Motion Blur</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-expert-tips-on-producing-high-quality-facebook-video/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Expert Tips on Producing High-Quality Facebook Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premier-5-minute-longshot-recorder/"><u>2024 Approved Premier 5-Minute Longshot Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/best-practice-for-incorporating-gopro-clips-into-360-video-tapestries-for-2024/"><u>Best Practice for Incorporating GoPro Clips Into 360 Video Tapestries for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/effective-fixes-and-tips-for-resolving-wacom-drawing-pad-issues/"><u>Effective Fixes and Tips for Resolving Wacom Drawing Pad Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/essential-skills-for-recording-private-whatsapp-talks/"><u>Essential Skills for Recording Private WhatsApp Talks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-from-motorola-razr-40-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass FRP from Motorola Razr 40?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/smart-networking-on-a-budget-the-ultimate-tp-link-archer-a6-ac1200-router-review-with-performance-breakdown/"><u>Smart Networking on a Budget: The Ultimate TP-Link Archer A6 AC1200 Router Review with Performance Breakdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/smartpacking-for-the-modern-wanderer/"><u>Smartpacking for the Modern Wanderer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/step-by-step-installation-tips-boosting-the-performance-of-your-intel-imac/"><u>Step-by-Step Installation Tips: Boosting the Performance of Your Intel iMac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/stream-smart-a-detailed-comparison-of-chromecast-vs-roku/"><u>Stream Smart: A Detailed Comparison of Chromecast Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Indoor TV antennas, like the AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna, can provide you with free broadcast TV channels. Once you pay the upfront cost for the antenna you’re not stuck with any monthly fees for your local channels. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are nothing like the bunny ear style antennas from back in the day. The picture quality is comparable to what you’d get from the cable company or streaming service—or it’s supposed to be. I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)</strong></h2><p> So many things<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >affect an antenna’s performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —location, household electronics, tree cover, tower location, and more. The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151884/7443" target="_top" id="2151884">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151884" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151884/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13. In new condition, it sells for $20, which is still a great deal. However, you can find other affordable antennas for between $20 and $50 that provide a much longer range, and many offer additional features, like a longer cable. With the AmazonBasics model, you can return the unit within 30 days if it doesn’t work in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MN6DSsu9Myyo6CdrSW5MJTjHoug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-4-fd9968307cb44c9d9e824750413e0028.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna"><a href="#AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna"></a><strong>AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/ANTOP-Omni-Directional-Indoor-HD-UHF-VHF-TV-Antenna/1000503257" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a 40-mile range antenna that sells for around $35. It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959778/19272" target="_top" id="1959778">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959778" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959778/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Ultra-Thin Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  AmazonBasics</li><li>SKU  DVB-T9088</li><li>Price  $20.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.09 x 13.31 x 0.075 in.</li><li>Warranty  30 day return policy, One year limited warranty</li><li>Resolution  1080p</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Frequency  174-230 MHz</li><li>Receiving range  VHF&#x2F;UHF</li><li>Atenna version  Passive</li><li>Ports  Coax</li><li>Cable length  10-foot Coax Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamlining-data-management-5-leading-cloud-providers/"><u>2024 Approved Streamlining Data Management 5 Leading Cloud Providers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-huawei-p20-pro-analysis-exceptional-photography-capabilities-meet-quality-mobile-device/"><u>Comprehensive Huawei P20 Pro Analysis - Exceptional Photography Capabilities Meet Quality Mobile Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/exclusive-oculus-quest-2-elite-gaming-headset-accessory-kit-with-durable-carry-pouch-in-depth-analysis-and-user-guide/"><u>Exclusive Oculus Quest 2 Elite Gaming Headset Accessory Kit with Durable Carry Pouch – In-Depth Analysis & User Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/hard-resetting-an-infinix-smart-7-device-made-easy-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Hard Resetting an Infinix Smart 7 Device Made Easy | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-activate-and-use-life360-ghost-mode-on-nokia-c22-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Activate and Use Life360 Ghost Mode On Nokia C22 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-use-life360-on-windows-pc-for-oneplus-ace-2v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For OnePlus Ace 2V?

Star Wars: Squadrons grants you the second of these fantasies to a never before seen degree. This long-overdue follow up to the 1993 classic Star Wars: X-Wing aims to offer the same intense dogfighting, but with the advantages of modern tech. I reviewed the PC version.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105873/7443" target="_top" id="2105873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Some-tinkering-required"><a href="#Setup-Some-tinkering-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Some tinkering required"></a><strong>Setup: Some tinkering required</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons has a fairly hefty download before it’s playable, so be sure your hard drive has at least 26.4 GB of storage space. When the game boots up you can alter basic settings to set language, volume, display settings, and everything else needed to optimize your experience. I struggled a bit to get it to play well with my dual-screen setup, but eventually, I was able to get it to a playable state on my ultra-widescreen Samsung CHG90 display. In the end, I found it more comfortable to play on a standard 16:9 aspect ratio monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1xt9t7ffMjuv6ggtXGJER_irSnk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-2-fcfb7e9a60e74ce9b42cecff0e2061ed.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps"><a href="#Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps" class="headerlink" title="Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps"></a><strong>Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps</strong></h2><p> The game picks up after the destruction of Alderaan in A New Hope. You get to play both sides of the conflict in alternating story missions as both an Imperial pilot and a Rebel pilot. Both characters are customizable with a range of preset options. I always appreciate it when a game gives me the option to create my own character.</p><p> The range of presets is fairly limited, but welcome nonetheless. As is traditional for me, I chose to rename the protagonists after characters from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. The Rebel hero became Lu-Tze, with the evil Vorbis on the side of the Empire. I was happy to be able to find a suitably sinister British accent for Vorbis, though hilarious results are possible with mismatched voices and characters. In the end, though, you’ll be spending most of the game from a first-person perspective, with your character only briefly present in cutscenes.</p><p>Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p> Next, you can choose whether you’d like a more guided experience with the standard HUD, or if you’d prefer a more immersive and challenging experience. The game also offers a mode where only your cockpit instruments are displayed. It’s probably a good idea to start off in the standard mode until you get to grips with the controls and gameplay. Lastly, choose your difficulty setting (which will depend on your general experience with flight games), and you’re off to battle.</p><p> Squadrons starts off with an obligatory tutorial mission to teach you how to fly. Though it’s somewhat prolonged, the initial awe of the scenery of an Imperial battlegroup banishes any boredom that you might expect from a tutorial mission. Gliding around Star Destroyers and other classic Star Wars spaceships is quite an experience.</p><p> The story is passable, if not terribly deep or ambitious, and is basically there to connect the battle sequences and give context to the fight. Voice acting varies from mediocre to passable, and there’s clearly some effort put into establishing likeable characters. However, though the character models are good, there’s definitely a bit of the uncanny valley on display here, and it’s particularly noticeable in the first-person conversations where you stare dumbly on as an NPC spouts exposition at you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_MN0adYtaTCJ1Qhmsivk-M-DkXo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-3-31074635684244d48b1d792540a477e2.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> In between story missions you are fixed in place in different rooms, where you click on different characters to talk to them. I found these sequences to be very linear and I found that they tended to drag on. I’d certainly have preferred to be able to walk around rather than teleport between locations on the ship. This is probably due to this game being intended to be played in VR where the fixed positioning makes more sense due to the limitations of VR, but the game would’ve been well served by separate control schemes. This is a minor gripe; if desired you can just skip through these sequences pretty quickly.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep"><a href="#Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep"></a><strong>Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep</strong></h2><p> The real meat of the game is in battle, and it’s an incredibly intense and immersive experience. Whatever system or control method you’re utilizing, there are a lot of different inputs and functions to learn. This would be daunting to newcomers, but the campaign does a great job of gradually introducing new controls and mechanics at a pace that makes them easy to pick up.</p><p> One of the most complex aspects of the game is team and system management, which involves making quick decisions about the layout of your ship and the behaviour of your allies. The basic power systems are easy to master, and simple “attack this” and “defend that” commands aren’t hard to learn, but there are more complicated systems as well that add a level of depth to the game for dedicated players.</p><p> Both the empire and rebels have a range of four classes of ships to choose from - a jack-of-all-trades fighter, a slow bomber with a fearsome arsenal of weapons, a fast and agile interceptor, and a support class ship. I really appreciated that the game doesn’t just make these reskinned mechanically identical clones for each faction. Instead, each side has its unique quirks that affect gameplay, and somehow the designers were still able to balance the game so that neither team feels outgunned by the other.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive. There is some of the traditional looping around in circles, but between the obstacles placed about the map, the different capabilities of the various ships, and the interaction between you and your teammates, this happens only occasionally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/COT6eEVvzd6QqCbhmtbP4a_C--Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-6-9d086810906a486b9266ec247e2ab966-3636fb8670644ae98afd0bc57b59df8d.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The one thing that pulled me out of the game at times was the somewhat wonky ship physics, which make sense from the pilot’s seat, but look a bit weird to see from other ships. You can stop quickly and turn on a dime, which benefits gameplay on a technical level, but is a bit jarring and unrealistic to witness.</p><p> One important aspect of gameplay is how Squadrons balances the fragility of its fighters with creating a fun experience. It does this using shields and repair kits that vary from ship to ship and which can be customized. It walks the fine line between allowing you to mow down enemy fighters without wailing away at them for ages, while also preventing you from feeling like you’re piloting a glass canon.</p><p> There’s also ship customization, which allows you to alter various aspects of your aircraft such as armament, hull, and engines to enhance various attributes, though this usually comes at a cost to other capabilities. For example, you can trade speed for extra agility and vice versa. It requires a deep understanding of the ship you’re customizing so you’ll probably want to wait to touch this till you’ve had plenty of practice in battle. There are also cosmetic customizations, such as paint jobs and ornaments. Both gameplay and cosmetic customizations are purchased with separate types of in-game currency.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous. Ships are lovingly rendered and great detail was paid to getting the lighting, environments, and effects just right. The cockpits of the different ships you pilot are fully realized and mesmerizing in their realism. It’s easy to get sucked into ogling a grand alien vista or just reveling in the experience of being in the cockpit of an honest to goodness X-Wing. Explosions, lasers, enemy ships tearing apart in fiery gouts of flame, and the realistic damage to your own ship, provoke many tense situations that hit home and are bound to get your heart racing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a-_aXPmbq5vlMG21Sutf0cIe4BI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-7-dc3679df974e4da793c52f2fb2831eac.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134247/18498" target="_top" id="2134247">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134247" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134247/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The game is less attractive in VR, with muddier textures and blurrier skybox, but the trade-off for added immersion is well worth the sacrifice. Actually moving your head to scan around the glass cockpit for enemy fighters and capital ships (or your own wingmates) and then diving in to engage is some of the most fun you can have in VR.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997657/19272" target="_top" id="1997657">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997657" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997657/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars"><a href="#Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Authentic Star Wars"></a><strong>Audio: Authentic Star Wars</strong></h2><p> With the vast majority of video games, your experience is almost as dependent on what you hear as what you see. In this regard, Squadrons is a masterpiece. This game perfectly replicates the epic feel of classic Star Wars space combat from the laser fire, to the roar of your engines, to the exhilarating whoosh of grazing an asteroid. There’s also the unforgettable John Williams soundtrack, which is fully present here and is just as vital to the experience of the game as it is to the films.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062447/7443" target="_top" id="1062447">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062447" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062447/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs"><a href="#Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs"></a><strong>Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs</strong></h2><p> I was able to get consistently high frame rates during gameplay with my custom gaming PC running 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X processor, and an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU. However, I experienced some odd stuttering in the hanger between missions, which seemed more of a graphical bug than an issue with the power of my PC. I also played Squadrons on a laptop with a less powerful processor, 16GB of RAM, and a Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q. The game performed well and provided a smooth gameplay experience at maximum graphical settings.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive.</p><h2 id="Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs"><a href="#Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs" class="headerlink" title="Controls: Wide support for different inputs"></a><strong>Controls: Wide support for different inputs</strong></h2><p> Squadrons offers customizable support for a wide range of different control schemes, from gamepads to HOTAS flight sticks to mouse and keyboard. I had to fiddle with a few settings to get my stick and thrust control up and running, but when I did, it added an extra layer of immersion to the experience. However, mouse and keyboard is clearly the optimal and intended control method for Squadrons.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights"><a href="#Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights"></a><strong>Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights</strong></h2><p> Squadrons features a basic but robust multiplayer mode, the bread and butter of which are team-based dogfights. These are exciting and challenging matches that truly test your skill at the game, and thanks to a decent selection of varied maps it really doesn’t get old.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oKG6kRHcFEOz3O6bwL5_SyeUiEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-4-78947bfe57874d45ae8f401482c3ddf6-379a507c078e44d6898e28d20f53aac9.jpeg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137972/21526" target="_top" id="2137972">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137972" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137972/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The other mode features massive large scale multi-stage fleet battles, which require careful team coordination to advance across the battlefield and destroy the enemies’ flagship.

It’s not the longest game, and there is a limit to end-game multiplayer content, so $40 is pretty much the exact right price for Squadrons. It’s refreshing to see a distinct lack of any extra monetization in the game, with no annoying microtransactions or loot boxes.</p><h2 id="Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous"><a href="#Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous"></a><strong>Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a deeper, more daunting, complex space sim, Elite Dangerous is the next step. Squadrons is far more exciting, being laser-focused on intense aerial combat. Elite Dangerous is a more methodical game, with a focus on exploration and trading, though there’s also exciting combat there if you want it.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> An exhilarating space combat experience that is particularly well suited to VR.</p><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is a fine successor to classic space combat games, and is an undeniably exciting and realistic experience. It’s best if played with a VR headset, but is worth your time and money on a traditional screen as well. The memory of my first flight at the helm of a TIE Fighter in this game has stuck with me with surprising clarity in a way that few moments in video games do, and it’s something you really have to experience for yourself to understand.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Star Wars: Squadrons</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Rating  Teen</li><li>Platform  PC, PS4, Xbox One</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-discover-the-art-of-vocal-variation-for-enhanced-gameplay-experience-free-guide/"><u>[Updated] Discover the Art of Vocal Variation for Enhanced Gameplay Experience (Free Guide)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-implementing-seamless-audio-diminishment-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Implementing Seamless Audio Diminishment for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-latest.techidaily.com/avi-mp4-2024-and9/"><u>Avi MP4形式におすすめ! 2024年のフリーソフトライブラリ - 最強セキュリティ&無料選択肢9点</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/comprehensive-look-at-the-eufy-t82-(video-doorbell-unlocking-security-without-a-recurring-fee/"><u>Comprehensive Look at the Eufy T82 <Video Doorbell: Unlocking Security Without a Recurring Fee</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/cyberpunk-2077-evaluation-an-imperfect-yet-remarkable-game/"><u>Cyberpunk 2077 Evaluation: An Imperfect Yet Remarkable Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/discover-how-to-save-on-phone-contracts-with-our-top-picks/"><u>Discover How to Save on Phone Contracts with Our Top Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/eliminating-error-code-0x80300024-from-pc/"><u>Eliminating Error Code: 0X80300024 From PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/evaluating-vonages-position-at-the-forefront-of-voip-innovation/"><u>Evaluating Vonage's Position at the Forefront of VoIP Innovation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/expert-choice-the-premier-extended-desk-mats-of-the-year/"><u>Expert Choice: The Premier Extended Desk Mats of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/focusflexpro-x7-smart-resizing-superior-quality/"><u>FocusFlexPro X7 Smart Resizing, Superior Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-or-downgrade-apple-iphone-xs-without-losing-data-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Upgrade or Downgrade Apple iPhone XS Without Losing Data? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/in-depth-insights-on-fugeteks-high-end-stick-for-selfies-the-reliable-and-solid-ft-568-reviewed/"><u>In-Depth Insights on Fugetek's High-End Stick for Selfies - The Reliable and Solid FT-568 Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/iphone-showdown-the-new-era-of-the-iphone-15-plus-versus-the-elite-pro-max/"><u>IPhone Showdown: The New Era of the iPhone 15 Plus Versus the Elite Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ct-your-mobile-shoot-expert-picks-of-the-best-9-cam-gear-for-2024/"><u>Perfect Your Mobile Shoot Expert Picks of the Best 9 Cam Gear for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tutorial-on-how-to-successfully-upload-videos-to-your-twitch-channel/"><u>Step-by-Step Tutorial on How to Successfully Upload Videos to Your Twitch Channel</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac) joins the Kinesis keyboard family with its easy-to-use modular design. Better yet, this ergonomic keyboard supports up to three connected devices at a time, allowing you to easily swap between a Mac, iPhone, or iPad with the press of a few hotkeys. With its compact build, the Kinesis Freestyle2 is a welcome addition to any Apple user’s collection, whether they’re at home or on the go, thanks to the excellent battery life of up to 300 plus hours of extended use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >The Best Ergonomic Keyboards of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold"></a><strong>Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold</strong></h2><p> For people who are tethered to their<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/computer-and-laptop-reviews-4102643" >computers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , ergonomic keyboards are a must. These keyboards tend to be large thanks to the frequently employed swoop design that opens up the keys to provide additional spacing, so fingers feel less cramped, and a wrist-friendly position that prevents<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while typing. These keyboards are typically space hogs, taking up large portions of any surface that they’re placed on, often forcing users to reach further for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-mice-6666207" >mice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This can lead to shoulder injuries in place of wrist injuries—a trade-off no one wants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C-YK_WPWu8Ujx1fwDLxvO6Epi-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_05-adcddc5fc05b415dbcd82396bc0ada77.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac breaks free of these norms by using a split, modular design that features two keyboard halves, one for each hand, connected via a 9 or 20-inch cable depending upon the chosen model. These pieces were designed with comfort in mind. They may be used separately or connected with a pivot tether at the top of the two halves. This allows you the opportunity to customize your setup and maximize your comfort, whether that’s by placing the halves closer together or further apart.</p><p> The Freestyle2’s minimum size is 15.4 inches in length, but it can extend to a maximum length of 23.5 inches (37.75 inches for the 20-inch model). It uses a standard key layout, so it’s familiar and easy to adjust to, while the low-impact design means that the keys need less pressure to type and are quieter. Additionally, its backside is free of risers letting your wrists sit in a neutral, comfortable position that helps prevent injuries over time.</p><p> Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300-plus hours of regular use.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack. Whether you’re commuting between the home and the office or you’re heading out of town for a vacation, it’s easy to break down and bring anywhere so long as there’s a flat surface to place it during use.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-For-Apple-products-only"><a href="#Setup-Process-For-Apple-products-only" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: For Apple products only"></a><strong>Setup Process: For Apple products only</strong></h2><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue arrives with the two keyboard halves, the instructional pamphlet, and a six-foot USB charging cable. Designed for use with iPads,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-and-ios-4781515" >iPhones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macs-4781332" >Macs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the setup process is quick and easy to complete. First, we flipped the switch on the right-hand side of the keyboard from the off position to the on position. Then, we flipped the keyboard over and pressed the connect button on the backside. We knew it was ready to begin pairing when the lights on the frontside began flashing blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XHY6Xe9cdaO1U6Uj0wDY6rROlcA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_04-7fad98b589454e0388ecf48afe425e8c.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> From here, we followed the instructions in the provided instructional pamphlet and enabled Bluetooth on our iPad. After about a minute of scanning, the Kinesis KB800MB-BT keyboard appeared as an available device. We simply tapped to connect. From here, it prompted us to input a numeric code and press return. Once we’d done this, setup was complete.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016170/19272" target="_top" id="2016170">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016170" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016170/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-Efficient-hotkeys-once-you-get-used-to-them"><a href="#Features-Efficient-hotkeys-once-you-get-used-to-them" class="headerlink" title="Features: Efficient hotkeys once you get used to them"></a><strong>Features: Efficient hotkeys once you get used to them</strong></h2><p> Better than its modular design are the easy-to-use hotkeys on the left-hand side of the keyboard. These make it simple to copy, paste, cut, go back or forward in a browser, or even switch between the keyboard’s connected devices smoothly and efficiently. They take a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it using them is a breeze.</p><p> One pet peeve we had with the keyboard design was the Caps lock key. Instead of having a light on the button itself that glows when the function is enabled, this light is placed alongside the Bluetooth connectivity lights on the right-hand side of the keyboard. While this isn’t the end of the world by any means, it’s less intuitive since you need to retrain yourself on where to look to see if it’s enabled. Additionally, you should be aware that leaving this button on or using it frequently can lead to faster battery drain.</p><p> Its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948954/19272" target="_top" id="1948954">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948954" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948954/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind"><a href="#Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind"></a><strong>Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind</strong></h2><p> The battery life on the Freestyle2 is excellent. It arrives with a partial charge, so it’s important to remember to fully charge it after receiving it. Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300 plus hours of regular use. The Freestyle2 does an excellent job of letting you know when its battery is getting low—battery lights will flash red to indicate when there are about four hours of battery life remaining. This ensures you’re never left hanging.</p><h2 id="Price-Excellent-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Excellent-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Excellent for the features"></a><strong>Price: Excellent for the features</strong></h2><p> Full-size ergonomic keyboards tend to retail anywhere from $50 to $200, depending on the features involved. Generally retailing for about $100 on Amazon, the Freestyle2 sits comfortably at the front of this curve. While $100 may seem expensive for a keyboard, consider the features involved. Its travel-friendly build, adjustable setup options, extended battery life, and ability to switch quickly and smoothly between multiple connected devices make it an excellent choice for the features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vncgu0FEgBJ69UL6H8BjQ2QoGRI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_03-9055476d1d974c8bbe9b1c39d479b300.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Kinesis-Freestyle2-Blue-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Kinesis-Freestyle2-Blue-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> Not all keyboards are created equal, and while the split, modular design offered by the Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue creates wonderful customization options, there’s something to be said for having a full keyboard. For Apple users willing to take a leap into Microsoft products, the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard shines through as an excellent option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-review-4780274" >Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While it may seem odd to lean into Microsoft products for Mac lovers, its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys. It also arrives with a mouse and detached numpad, which are some nice perks as the Freestyle2 doesn’t include the numpad, although it is available as an accessory for an additional $40. The Windows key may also be mapped to the command key on the Sculpt. Generally retailing for about $80-$120, the Sculpt is around the same price as the Kinesis.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack.</p><p> One drawback to this device is that the receiver dongle used to pair the Sculpt to your computer is associated with the keyboard at the factory. This is because the keyboard features encryption technology in order to protect your keystrokes. If this dongle is lost, there simply is no replacing it. With this information in mind, this keyboard would do best in an environment where it stays put rather than the Freestyle2 which is much more travel-friendly thanks to its compact nature and Bluetooth pairing capabilities.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An ideal keyboard for Apple users with its compact design, portability, and long-lasting battery.</strong></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac is a compact, user-friendly ergonomic keyboard that takes comfort and customization to the next level for Apple users thanks to its split, modular design. Its extended battery life of up to 300 plus hours combined with its ability to connect to multiple iOS devices at a time is a game-changer, making it well worth the splurge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135399/19272" target="_top" id="2135399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135399/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Freestyle2 Blue</li><li>Product Brand  Kinesis</li><li>SKU  KB800HMB-BT</li><li>Price  $99.00</li><li>Weight  2 lbs.</li><li>Warranty  2-year limited warranty on keyboards and accessories</li><li>Range  Approximately 30 feet</li><li>Battery  Rechargeable lithium polymer battery</li><li>Separation  9 or 20-in. versions</li><li>Product Dimensions (9-Inch Version)  Min: 15.375 in.;

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is so cumbersome, unsightly, and complicated that I secretly wanted it to fail. Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982461%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982461/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134224/18498" target="_top" id="2134224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134224/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918714/19272" target="_top" id="1918714">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918714" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918714/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-expert-tips-for-quality-video-with-nvidia-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expert Tips for Quality Video with NVIDIA for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-revolutionize-visual-narratives-using-prime-text-extensions/"><u>[New] Revolutionize Visual Narratives Using Prime Text Extensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-safe-techniques-for-extracting-and-converting-youtube-audio-into-mp3-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Safe Techniques for Extracting and Converting YouTube Audio Into MP3 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-gaming-options-asus-steam-deck-vs-rog-ally/"><u>Exploring Gaming Options: ASUS Steam Deck Vs.

As much as I love my gaming laptops, both of my models, an Eluktronics and an MSI, both feel like they’re about to catch fire whenever I’m playing a heavy-hitting game like Division or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/destiny-2-4158011" >Destiny 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> A couple gaming sessions later, and I realized I needed a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >laptop cooling pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . After taking a look at various models, I decided to try out the HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad. It boasts five fans and an adjustable rollout switch to customize my cooling experience. And it offers anti-slip baffles so my curious cat can’t knock it off my laptop. After over a year of use, I still use this almost every day for my gaming needs. Read on for our final verdict, as well as thoughts on its specs.</p><h2 id="Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad"><a href="#Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad" class="headerlink" title="Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad"></a>Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad</h2><p> HAVIT offers this laptop cooling pad in two different colors: red and blue. I personally felt that the red would be too bright and opted for the blue; when I pulled it out of the box, I was surprised at how heavy its 1.8 pounds felt in my hand.</p><p> On top of the pad itself, it comes with a braided USB cord for protection. It could plug into one of two ports, of which I used the spare to add USB charging for USB compatible items like my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-kindle-2019-review-4688850" >Amazon Kindle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jabra-talk-45-review-5070286" >Java Bluetooth headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J6RTKS-ZdzNqPyF_Tm9lloOF1iM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_04-5a7071fefb884ba19eb68638fdbf1b2b.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust. If you’re looking for a simple design, this is not your cooling pad. That being said, the metal mesh pad for air circulation can accommodate laptops ranging from 14 to 17 inches thanks to its 15.87 x 11.81 x 1.34 inches (LWH) in dimension.</p><h2 id="Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away"><a href="#Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away" class="headerlink" title="Fans: Wasn’t blown away"></a>Fans: Wasn’t blown away</h2><p> I set up the cooling pad and flipped on the roller switch. HAVIT promises five quiet fans—one 110-millimeter fan, and four other strategically placed 85-millimeter fans. HAVIT holds true to its promise: This cooling pad emits a fairly faint sound I can’t hear through my Samsung Buds headphones, even with their noise cancelling features. The fans are so quiet that if I was gaming, I wasn’t able to hear them.</p><p> Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees.</p><p> Better yet, I could adjust the fans to customize how much air I wanted to circulate due to the roller switch HAVIT put as the on&#x2F;off switch. If I wasn’t sure about how much power I was putting into the fans, I could simply lift my laptop up from the pad; as I turned up the power, the blue LED lights in the cooling pad grew brighter.</p><p> Before getting this cooling pad, my Eluktronics laptop sounded like an airplane was taking off and landing at my desk space. I wish I could say that this changed after implementing the pad into my gaming rig, or even with my MSI laptop. Unfortunately, my laptops’ fans still sound like I’m on the tarmac instead of being at home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/l2nDOOm1dGSmniJBqJPn708DnK8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_03-71babed64c14425184604e4825680aac.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> That’s not to say that this laptop cooling pad doesn’t help cool it down. Since my Eluktronics is getting some much-needed TLC in the shop, I tested the MSI’s internal temps while running<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tropico-6-review-5077604" >Tropico Six <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on my laptop. Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees. It’s not much, but it’s enough to make a difference.</p><h2 id="Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing"><a href="#Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing" class="headerlink" title="Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing"></a>Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing</h2><p> If you feel the laptop needs more circulation, the good news is that HAVIT also anticipated these needs, too. Anti-slip baffles offer a sturdy position on any desk, even if you push up the height to a more angled position.</p><p> There is a sturdy flap should you prefer the angled laptop pad, or if you prefer, a sturdier laptop placement while flat. I tested out the height adjustment for a little while, but ultimately decided against using them for personal preference instead of durability reasons.</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hXjExslBR5KBA1RSMPFlkkvF1uQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_02-f065f40118184391b6f1ba1bffa763bd.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352557/5172" target="_top" id="352557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352557/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> And, if you’re on-the-go and travelling, the HAVIT 5 also packs quite nicely into a suitcase.

But if you need to go across country and want to take your gaming laptop with you, this is a good one that will hold up well in luggage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144308/7443" target="_top" id="2144308">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144308" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144308/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Ouch"><a href="#Price-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Price: Ouch"></a>Price: Ouch</h2><p> I picked up my HAVIT 5 while it was on sale for around $30 back in 2019, but the usual price is around $50. That seems a little steep, especially for fans that don’t necessarily pack the punch for gaming that most laptops require. If you keep an eye on Amazon, you can usually get this one for around $30, as it seems to go on sale fairly often.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lItC7F6Ja8RbBfTaNXh5l9ufFqY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_05-07577b69f7d04de5a7904e798681ba02-6b3615a38d584594b89077eaf51228b2.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977020">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977020.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977020">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977020.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977020%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977020/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> It makes sense to compare the Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad to the HAVIT. Both have five cooling fans, both fit laptops up to 17 inches, and both offer anti-slip baffles to ensure your laptop is safe if you want to adjust the height for more air circulation or wrist angle preferences. The key differences are design and adjustability.</p><p> While the HAVIT is clearly a gaming laptop cooling pad, the Kootak features smooth edges and has a more universal aesthetic to its design. The Kootak is also cheaper, at around $37. If you prefer a true gaming cooling pad, go with the HAVIT. If you don’t care about aesthetics and prefer to be cost conscious, the Kootak will be better suited to your needs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Good, but could be great.</strong></p><p> It’s not the best out there, but so long as it cools the internal laptop core temperatures by about 20 degrees, it’s a worthy investment. Props go to HAVIT for giving it a roller switch for ultimate adjustability and an LED light that will show how high the fans are blowing. The fans could be stronger, but quieter fans over more power is preferable.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/urban-armor-gear-macbook-pro-case-review-4689954" >Urban Armor Gear MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  5 Fan Laptop Cooler</li><li>Product Brand  HAVIT</li><li>MPN  HV-F2068</li><li>Price  $50.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2017</li><li>Weight  1.8 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15.87 x 11.81 x 1.34 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Voltage  5V</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li><li>Connectivity Options  USB port (one cord included)</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-5-video-editing-software-excluding-youtube/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Essential 5 Video Editing Software Excluding Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-4k-desktop-screens-full-integration-and-touch/"><u>2024 Approved Ultimate 4K Desktop Screens Full Integration & Touch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/android-safe-mode-how-to-turn-off-safe-mode-on-nokia-c12-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Android Safe Mode - How to Turn off Safe Mode on Nokia C12? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/bypassing-geforce-experiences-error-on-windows-pcs/"><u>Bypassing GeForce Experience's Error on Windows PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/chatgpt-plus-is-it-valuable-unveiling-5-essential-perks-of-enrolling-today/"><u>ChatGPT Plus: Is It Valuable?
