## Top Rated HDMI Switchers : Your Ultimate Guide

HDMI switches solve the problem that some TVs have—not having enough HDMI ports. With an HDMI switch, you can add to your TVs total number of HDMI ports without reducing quality. An HDMI switch can also be handy at your computer setup or in a media room.

##  What to Look For in an HDMI Switch

 When searching for an HDMI switch, you’ll first need to consider how many HDMI connections you need. Look at how many HDMI input ports your TV already has, count the number of HDMI input devices you have, and consider how many extra ports you want to account for future devices you might purchase.

 For most people, an HDMI switch with four inputs and one output (written as 4x1 in product listings) is plenty. This allows for a [streaming stick](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-prime-selection-of-screen-capture-software-for-gaming/), a gaming console, a [Blu-ray player](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/ultimate-actions-replay-analysis/), and one extra device to all plug into your TV simultaneously through the switch.

 If you’re looking for a device that can do the opposite—take one input and display it to multiple outputs—you need an HDMI splitter, not an HDMI switch. Or, if you’re looking for something with multiple input and output ports, you should be looking for an HDMI Matrix that combines the properties of an HDMI switch and an HDMI splitter.

 Once you know you need an HDMI switch and you have an idea of how many input ports you need, it’s time to think about your desired resolution, frame rate, and special features.

 There are HDMI switches that only support 1080p resolution, but we don’t have any on our list because the 4K options are just as affordable and many modern TVs support 4K. If you have an 8K TV, some switches support this high of a resolution.

 Regarding frame rate, most HDMI switches offer 4K at 30Hz or 60Hz. If you only plan to stream media, a 30Hz refresh rate is fine, but a smoother 60Hz refresh rate is recommended if you want to play games. All options on our list support a 60Hz refresh rate because it’s not that much of a price jump from options that support 30Hz. You can even splurge on an HDMI switch that supports 4K at a 120Hz refresh rate, like the [Kinivo HDMI switch](https://www.amazon.com/Kinivo-HDMI-Switch-8K-Port/dp/B0B8SSBKXF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-switches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) on our list.

 It’s important to note that all your devices must support the same resolution and frame rate you’re trying to achieve. For example, if you want to use an HDMI switch to play games and stream media on your TV at a 4K resolution and a 60Hz refresh rate, your console, streaming device, HDMI switch and cable, and your TV will all need to be capable of supporting 4K@60Hz.

 If your TV only supports 1080p, buying an HDMI switch that supports 4K cannot make your TV produce a 4K resolution. Similarly, buying an HDMI switch that supports 1080p to use with your 4K TV will end up lowering the resolution and only producing a 1080p picture on your TV.

 The same goes for refresh rate and any special features you may want, like Dolby Atmos, HDR, Dolby Vision, and others. If you’re unsure what features to look for, try inspecting your existing TV, console, and/or streaming stick to see what features they support. Then, try to find HDMI switches that support those same features if they’re important to you.

 Lastly, many HDMI switches come with a remote that makes it easy to swap between your devices from afar, but a remote isn’t a given. Some budget-friendly options won’t offer a remote, so you’ll need to manually switch inputs by pushing a button on the HDMI switch.

| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Five HDMI 2.0 inputs (4K@60Hz supported)   | ✗ Doesn’t come with an AC power adapter (which is required) |

 For most, the [SGEYR HDMI switch](https://www.amazon.com/SGEYR-Selector-Switcher-Compatible-Projector/dp/B07MCS9PJD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-switches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers plenty of input ports at a great price. There are five HDMI 2.0 inputs and a single HDMI 2.0 output, all of which support 4K resolution at 60Hz, HDCP 2.2, [HDR](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/), and Dolby Vision. You can quickly switch between connected devices manually with a button on the device, from the couch with the included remote control, or via auto switching.

 It’s worth noting that some devices don’t support auto switching by default, like Apple TV, Xbox One, PS5, and Roku. If your device supports auto switching, this means the SGEYR switch will automatically detect when it turns on and switch to that specific input right away.

 SGEYR’s HDMI switch is super compact, measuring only 5.8 x 2.4 x 0.8 inches, and its body is made of a durable metal material. It’s also equipped with 24K gold-plated HDMI connectors to extend the overall life of its ports.

 Some [Amazon reviews](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28BH0MATTU45O?ref=pf%5Fvv%5Fat%5Fpdctrvw%5Fsrp&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-switches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) between 2020 and early 2022 mention that this HDMI switch doesn’t come with an AC power adapter. However, recent reviews don’t mention this, and the Amazon listing says it comes with a DC 5V power adapter, so a missing AC adapter shouldn't be an issue. Make sure to double-check, though!

| ✓ No external power supply needed | ✗ No auto-switching support                  |

 If you’re looking to save some money and you have three or fewer devices to connect to your TV or monitor, check out this [avedio links HDMI Switch](https://www.amazon.com/avedio-links-Switcher-Splitter-Support/dp/B07RZNG5Q4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-switches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). All three HDMI ports support 2.0 technology, meaning they can support an output of 4K resolution at 60Hz as long as your device supports 4K@60Hz.

 This HDMI switch also supports HDCP 2.2, [HDR](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/), Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos technologies. There’s no remote control included to switch inputs from afar, and auto switching isn’t supported, so you’ll need to switch inputs on the device itself manually.

 The avedio links HDMI switch is constructed using aluminum alloy material that’s durable and helps dissipate heat. It’s a small square device that doesn’t take up much room on your TV stand, measuring 7.7 x 7.3 x 1 inches. And you won’t need to find another space on your power strip for a wall adapter because avedio links’ HDMI switch gets all the power it needs from your input devices.

| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Four HDMI 2.1 inputs that support 4K@120Hz (or 8K@60Hz) | ✗ More expensive than 4K@60Hz options     |
| ✓ Can switch inputs manually or via remote                | ✗ Included remote’s signal can be finicky |
| ✓ Supports auto switching (and disabling auto switching)  |                                           |
| ✓ Durable build with excellent heat dissipation           |                                           |

 To get the most out of your 4K setup, splurge on [Kinivo’s 8K HDMI switch](https://www.amazon.com/Kinivo-HDMI-Switch-8K-Port/dp/B0B8SSBKXF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-switches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This switch supports four HDMI 2.1 inputs that can handle a signal of 8K resolution at 60Hz, which is great for future-proofing your setup. If you’re displaying a signal of only 4K resolution, you can do so at 120Hz with this HDMI switch, as long as your input devices support 4K@120Hz.

 In addition to supporting a smooth 4K picture, this HDMI switch supports HDR 10+, [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/), and HDCP 2.3 technologies. The HDMI connectors are 24K gold-plated for longevity, and the switch device itself is encased in an aluminum alloy shell that helps dissipate heat. For as powerful as this device is, it’s surprisingly little, measuring only 5.8 x 4 x 3.2 inches.

 You can switch between the four inputs by pushing a button on the device, using the included remote, or taking advantage of the built-in auto-switching support. If you’re unfamiliar with the term ‘auto switching,’ it just means that when you turn on an input device, the switch will automatically detect which input device has just been turned on and swap to it. Some devices natively don’t support auto switching, like Roku devices, Apple TV, PS5, or Xbox One.

 FERRISA’s [HDMI matrix](https://www.amazon.com/FERRISA-Splitter-Optical-Downscaler-Extractor/dp/B0B8Y4WH1V?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-switches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the perfect solution if you’re looking for something that can handle multiple inputs at once and send one of those inputs at a time to two displays. Four HDMI 2.0 inputs support a 4K@60Hz signal and two HDMI 2.0 outputs support the same resolution and frame rate, as well as audio extraction. You can plug in headphones via the 3.5mm jack or the optical audio output.

 Switching between your input and output devices is easy, whether you use the buttons on the matrix, the included remote, or auto-switching support. The FERRISA matrix also supports HDR 10, HDCP 2.2, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Digital technologies. At 7.5 x 2.7 x 1 inches, it won’t take up much space on your TV stand.

 Most importantly, FERRISA’s HDMI matrix supports downscaling. This means that if you have one display with a 1080p max resolution, and another with 4K max resolution, this matrix won’t automatically downgrade both displays to 1080p like many matrix devices will. Instead, each screen displays its max resolution while receiving the same signal from one input.

 If you want to send a signal from a single input device to more than one display, check out this [OREI splitter](https://www.amazon.com/Orei-HDMI-Splitter-Duplicater-OREI/dp/B0891WY8SF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-switches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This is the best HDMI splitter for most people, whether you’re looking to display your cable signal on multiple TVs throughout the house or put a digital menu up in various spots across your restaurant.

 OREI’s 1x4 splitter has one HDMI 2.0 input and four HDMI 2.0 outputs that all support a 4K resolution at 60 Hz. It’s compatible with all [HDMI devices](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/mastering-final-cut-the-ultimate-guide/), and you’ll find support for HDCP 2.2, Dolby-AC3, and Dolby TrueHD/DTS-HD master audio. At 5.9 x 2.4 x 0.8 inches, it’s incredibly compact and lightweight.

 This splitter also supports downscaling, so if you have one 4K display and three 1080p displays, you’ll get max resolution on your 4K display and it’ll automatically scale the video down to 1080p max on your other three displays. Some splitters recognize the lowest resolution possible among all outputs and match that low resolution to all displays regardless of what each can actually support.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between an HDMI switch and an HDMI splitter?

 An HDMI switch has multiple inputs that can be displayed on a single output, whereas an HDMI splitter has one input that can be displayed on multiple outputs. For more information, check out our guide on [HDMI switches vs HDMI splitters](https://howto.techidaily.com/full-guide-how-to-fix-connection-is-not-private-on-samsung-galaxy-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/).

### Will using an HDMI switch reduce image quality?

 It depends on all your devices. HDMI is a digital signal, so it won’t degrade like analog signals, but your image quality will only be as clear as your lowest-image-quality device. If your TV is capable of 4K, and you purchase an HDMI switch only capable of 1080p, your TV will only be able to display a lower-quality 1080p picture.

### When should I use an HDMI switch?

 An HDMI switch comes in handy when you have multiple input devices (consoles, streaming sticks, Blu-ray/DVD player) that you want to connect to your TV, computer, or another display, and your output device doesn’t have enough HDMI ports.
