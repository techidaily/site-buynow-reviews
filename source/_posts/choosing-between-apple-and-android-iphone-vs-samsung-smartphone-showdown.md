## IPhone vs Samsung: A Battle of Tech Giants to Find Your Perfect Phone Match

 Together, Apple and Samsung make up nearly two-thirds of the smartphone market. The popularity of iPhones and Galaxies is due to good design, user experience, personalization, and brand loyalty.

 If you're unsure which brand to choose for your next device, this guide can help. Here are some things to consider when deciding between an iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy.

 The latest models are the[**iPhone 15**](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-128-Unlimited-trade/dp/B0CHBNXW73?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4684088%7Cn16eccee1143f4cb689761c2fa99f306222%7C) and[**Galaxy S24**](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Processor-SM-S921UZKAXAA/dp/B0CMDRCZBJ?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4684088%7Cn16eccee1143f4cb689761c2fa99f306222%7C) .

## Choose an iPhone for Better Compatibility

 What We Like

* Continuity with other Apple devices.

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't work well on devices with other popular systems, such as Android, Windows, and ChromeOS.

 An iPhone is ideal for owning a Mac computer, iPad, or Apple Watch. You can start activities or projects on one Apple device and continue where you left off on another.

 Apple's[AirDrop](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-airdrop-how-does-it-work-1994512) feature also makes transferring files from one iOS or macOS device to another easy.

 Additionally, Apple Watches are only compatible with iOS and Mac devices. That means if you want an Apple smartwatch, you need an iPhone to fully use it.

## Choose a Samsung for Better Customization

 What We Like

* Set up apps and programs like TWRP Custom Recovery for advanced customization access.

 What We Don't Like

* Gaining root access to a device can render it unusable if not done correctly.

 Samsung customizes its user interface to be different from other Android devices. Older devices use Samsung Experience, while newer devices with at least Android Pie use[Samsung One UI](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-samsung-one-ui-4178405) .

 Samsung's interface is minimalistic, intuitive, and task-focused. You'll spend less time looking for apps and functions and more time doing what you want with your device.

 Design-wise, Samsung devices have a theme library. You can create themes to give your device a unique look.

![The Galaxy S24 series](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cvIv1_B0-a_lUWKCodaZTitsoy8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Galaxy-S24-series-side-8dcbaec3364645939e41673b77364f49.jpg)

Samsung

 If you're an advanced user,[root](https://www.lifewire.com/rooting-an-android-device-4048396) your Samsung device and[install custom recovery firmware](https://www.lifewire.com/install-twrp-android-4582500) to access its back end. Many people use these methods to install leaked updates and programs not included on Samsung devices.

 There's some risk in performing such functions, but many superusers like knowing they can do it.

## Choose an iPhone for Regular OS Updates

 What We Like

* iOS updates release in a timely fashion for all compatible devices.

 What We Don't Like

* May have to wait while bugs and other small issues are patched with smaller updates.

 When the latest iOS update is released, it's available to the[newest iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-newest-iphone-6746797) and often several models from previous years, all at the same time. It takes a few months for most iOS users to update to the latest system version. Most Samsung devices only get the newest version of Android when it's first released.

## Choose a Samsung for Expandable Storage Options

 What We Like

* Manually add more storage if the internal storage isn't enough.

 What We Don't Like

* MicroSD cards for expandable storage are typically sold separately.

 Samsung devices use a microSD card to expand their storage. Users can expand the internal storage on some Samsung phones up to 1 TB.

 Prices vary depending on the brand and capacity, but microSD cards are often on sale at stores like Best Buy and Target. Samsung also occasionally offers deals to get a free microSD card when purchasing a new device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Choose an iPhone for a Greater Variety of Apps

 What We Like

* iOS users are typically the first to know about the latest new app craze.

 What We Don't Like

* iOS apps tend to consume more space than Android apps.

 Apps typically release an update on iPhones before other devices because developers find it easier to create on iOS. Many developers wait until apps become popular on iOS before attempting to build an Android version. If you want to make sure you have access to the latest apps, the iPhone may be the better choice.

## Choose a Samsung for Better Displays

 What We Like

* Samsung hasn't adopted the top-notch design.

 What We Don't Like

* Replacing broken or damaged screens can be costly.

 Samsung devices have one of the best displays on the market. The Samsung OLED displays are known for their rich color and detail and are on all[Galaxy S models](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s-phones-4156903) .

[OLED](https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091) displays are great for watching videos and displaying pictures. While the super-premium iPhones also have OLED displays, if you want a lower-cost or older iPhone, you may have to settle for LCD, which isn't as bright and has less color variation.

## Choose an iPhone for Faster Performance

 What We Like

* Don't have to close apps for better performance.

 What We Don't Like

* iOS navigation can be challenging.

 Many people enjoy how iPhones seem to run fast and smoothly, with few instances of freezing or crashing.

 High-performance functions like gaming, watching videos, or having several apps open at once don't seem to slow an iPhone down. Some iPhone navigation and gestures may be challenging for those unfamiliar with iOS, but these gestures are easy to learn.

## Choose a Samsung for Better Battery Life

 What We Like

* Samsung devices tend to have longer daily battery life with typical use.

 What We Don't Like

* High-performance users may experience faster battery drain.

 Despite fumbles from the past, Samsung devices tend to have decent battery life due to the large batteries. Some Samsung smartphones also support Super Fast Charging; these include the S24, Z Fold 5, and others.

## Choose an iPhone for Better Security Options

 What We Like

* Users that stay away from risky behaviors are comparatively safe.

 What We Don't Like

* Bugs can lay dormant for some time.

 Apple devices have a high level of security. While not foolproof, if you avoid risky practices, you can[keep your iPhone free of bugs and viruses](https://www.lifewire.com/is-it-possible-iphone-virus-1999742) . Other ways to keep an iPhone safe are keeping iOS up to date, not installing unauthorized apps, services, or programs, and having strong passwords.

## Choose a Samsung for Great Camera Specs

 What We Like

* Great for low light photography.

 What We Don't Like

* Can struggle to capture image and video detail, especially in third-party apps.

 Samsung improved the quality of its cameras significantly over the years. Samsung mobile cameras are some of the best among Android devices. Some of the top functions include a wide-angle mode, low-light HDR, and a scene optimizer, which adjusts the camera settings to get the ideal shot based on the subject.

## Choose an iPhone for Better Camera Features

 What We Like

* High Dynamic Range features are superb.

 What We Don't Like

* Low light images can be lackluster.

 The iPhone's cameras shine. Many users find it easier to get a first-time shot with an iPhone, and images don't suffer from a lack of detail or overexposure.

 Features like[Live Photos](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-live-photos-1999618) are famous for sharing, as these capture three-second GIFs. iPhone cameras are also ideal for capturing images and videos on third-party apps like Instagram and Snapchat.

## Choose a Samsung If You Prefer a Headphone Jack

 What We Like

* Can use a standard 3.5mm audio jack with the latest Samsung devices.

 What We Don't Like

* No real downside to this feature.

 Samsung phones are some of the only new smartphones with 3.5mm audio jacks. While the[latest Samsung Galaxy phones](https://www.lifewire.com/newest-samsung-galaxy-phone-7567396) , like the S24, do not include one, others, like the Galaxy A25 5G and the Galaxy S10/10+, have headphone jacks. All of Samsung's older devices include one, too. The 2016 iPhone SE was the last iPhone built with a headphone jack.

## iPhone vs. Samsung: Which Is Better?

 Both Apple and Samsung phones are excellent, with pros and cons. An iPhone may be ideal for those who want a straightforward user experience.

 A Samsung device may be better for power users who like more control and variety. Choosing a new smartphone comes down to lifestyle and personal preference.
