 It has a built-in USB-C cable, a second USB-C port, and a USB-A port. These options ensure compatibility with basically anything that charges over USB, including headphones, laptops, phones, and watches.

 To highlight its efficiency, the charger can power up an iPhone 15 Pro from empty to approximately 60 percent in just 30 minutes. Plus, the device itself only needs a couple of hours to top up.

 Finally, it's safe for air travel, making it the perfect companion for all your summer plans.
