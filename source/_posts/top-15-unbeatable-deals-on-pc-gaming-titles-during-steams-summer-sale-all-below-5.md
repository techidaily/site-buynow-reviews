## Top 15 Unbeatable Deals on PC Gaming Titles During Steamâ€™s Summer Sale â€“ All Below $5

Summer is here, and with it comes a new wave of deep gaming discounts courtesy of Steam's Summer Sale. But stocking up on games for the summer doesn't need to be expensive. I've pulled together this list of truly exceptional games that you can snag for $5 or less.

## 1 [Portal 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal%5F2/): $0.99 

 Valve's incredible follow-up to the first-person, portal-based puzzle game takes everything that worked so well from the original game and makes it even better. [_Portal 2_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal%5F2/) gives you more lore to uncover, more dry humor from lovable bots, and more puzzles to wrap your head around. And it makes [a brilliant couch co-op game](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-earnings-expertise-for-youtube-creators-fb-insights-and-tactics/)!

 The original [_Portal_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/) is also available for just $0.99 in the sale, or if you haven't played either game, you get them both in [a bundle](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/234/Portal%5FBundle/) for $1.49.

## 2 [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/): $1.99 

 Stunning pixel art, lovable characters, and challenging platforming come together perfectly in [_Celeste_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/). You play as Madeline, climbing to the peak of Celeste Mountain, and overcoming her own inner demons in the process. Oh, and when I said "challenging platforming," I meant it. This game is _hard_, but it's tight controls and fast respawn make it a thrill to keep playing.

## 3 [UNDERTALE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/): $2.49 

 Truly a game for gamers, [_UNDERTALE_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/) is an RPG that revels in toying with your gaming preconceptions. You've probably already heard that you don't actually need to kill anyone in this dungeon-based RPG, but that isn't the only surprise in store for war-weary players. You'll have to play it yourself to discover the rest, though.

## 4 [XCOM: Enemy Unknown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200510/XCOM%5FEnemy%5FUnknown/): $2.99 

 Earth is under alien attack, and in [_XCOM_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200510/XCOM%5FEnemy%5FUnknown/) it's your job to command an international coalition of forces to defend against it. In this turn-based tactical game, you'll build a secret underground base, plan which global emergencies to respond to, research recovered alien tech, and develop highly-trained soldiers to follow your direction in operations. It's an addictive gameplay loop thanks to the delicate balance of random encounters and strategic planning.

 Can also get the follow-up, [_XCOM 2_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268500/XCOM%5F2/), for $2.99.

## 5 [Sid Meierâ€™s Civilization VI](https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid%5FMeiers%5FCivilization%5FVI/): $2.99 

 Speaking of turn-based strategy games, Sid Meier's _Civilization_ games are the best around, and _[Civilization VI](http://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid%5FMeiers%5FCivilization%5FVI/)_ is the latest addition to the series (though we're expecting _Civilization VII_ next year). This is one of our recommended [games if you're playing on a touchpad](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/unveiling-secrets-sharper-facebook-videos-on-android-for-2024/), as it doesn't depend on fast reactions or precision clicks. Instead, you can carefully consider each decision as you lead your chosen civilization from the ancient era on to (hopefully) win the race to Mars.

## 6 [Borderlands 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands%5F2/): $3.00 

 If you're just looking for a good time, Borderlands is it. Oozing with humor and personality, this loot-and-shoot adventure on the junkyard planet of Pandora is heaps of fun, especially if you tag a friend for [some multiplayer gaming](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-achieve-high-rankings-on-youtube-with-top-seo-tips-1-11-for-2024/). There's even a star-studded _[Borderlands](https://borderlands.movie/)_ movie coming out this summer. There are several games in the Borderlands series, and they just get better and better, but _[Borderlands 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands%5F2/)_ is the only one available for under $5 in this sale and you don't need to have played the first game to enjoy it.

## 7 [Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/241930/Middleearth%5FShadow%5Fof%5FMordor/): $3.99 

[_Shadow of Mordor_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/241930/Middleearth%5FShadow%5Fof%5FMordor/) sees you take control of a supernaturally powered-up ranger, exploring Middle-Earth and battling through hordes of enemy orcs. Its fluid battles are brilliantly gruesome, but the coolest aspect of the game is its "nemesis" system. This sees enemy orcs gain abilities, scars, and memories based on how you fought them, which they'll bring up and react to the next time you meet.

 This game was followed up with a bigger, broader sequel, _[Middle-Earth: Shadow of War](https://store.steampowered.com/app/356190/Middleearth%5FShadow%5Fof%5FWar/)_, which is reduced to $2.49 at the moment. But the original is the best one to start with.

## 8 [The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt](https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The%5FWitcher%5F3%5FWild%5FHunt/): $3.99 

 One of the greatest games of all time, [_The Witcher 3_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The%5FWitcher%5F3%5FWild%5FHunt/) puts you in the shoes of Geralt or Rivia, a monster-hunter for hire in a land ravaged by war. Of course, it feels pretty exciting taking down the various fantastical beasts you encounter across the Continent, but more engaging than that are the endless well-told quests that work to make this world feel so fully realized.

 This is best enjoyed if you've played the previous _Witcher_ games, but doing so definitely isn't essential if you just want to get stuck into the best one right away.

## 9 [Disco Elysium - The Final Cut](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco%5FElysium%5F%5FThe%5FFinal%5FCut/): $3.99 

 There's been a murder, and it's your job to investigate it. The problem is, you're so hungover you barely remember your own name. That's how [_Disco Elysium_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco%5FElysium%5F%5FThe%5FFinal%5FCut/) begins, and it's a great representation of the dark, sharply-written, and often surprisingly funny gameplay. The Final Cut edition that's on sale includes fully-voiced performances for the huge cast of characters found in the gameâ€”including various parts of your own mindâ€”making the experience of playing even more captivating.

## 10 [Batman: Arkham City](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200260/Batman%5FArkham%5FCity%5F%5FGame%5Fof%5Fthe%5FYear%5FEdition/): $3.99 

 Talking about this game has become a clichÃ© in and of itself because it really, _really_ does make you feel like Batman. Explore Gotham City, skulking alongside gargoyles, grappling through the skies, and beating up thugs in fast-flowing combat. There are several Arkham gamesâ€”this being the second in the seriesâ€”but in my opinion [_Arkham City_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/) is the best of the lot, having expanded the map from _[Arkham Asylum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/35140/Batman%5FArkham%5FAsylum%5FGame%5Fof%5Fthe%5FYear%5FEdition/)_ with a much stronger story than _[Arkham Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/208650/Batman%5FArkham%5FKnight/)_ (both of which are also available for under $5).

## 11 [Firewatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/Firewatch/): $3.99 

 You don't need a summer vacation if you've got [_Firewatch_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/Firewatch/), which lets you experience a slice of life as a ranger in the picturesque Wyoming wilderness. That said, it isn't all idyllic walks in the park as you start discovering oddities and trying to get to the bottom of them alongside a new friend on the other end of a walkie talkie. This is a perfect game to complete on a weekend, and one that's a joy to come back to multiple times.

## 12 [STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172380/STAR%5FWARS%5FJedi%5FFallen%5FOrder/): $3.99 

[_Fallen Order_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/1172380/STAR%5FWARS%5FJedi%5FFallen%5FOrder/) was a delightful surprise when it released: it's an excellent Star Wars game, with iconic new characters, a gripping story, dazzling graphics, and thoroughly enjoyable gameplay. It's really a must-play for any Star Wars fans, and once you've done so, you'll probably want to jump right into the recent follow-up [_STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1774580/STAR%5FWARS%5FJedi%5FSurvivor/), which is available for $31.49.

## 13 [DOOM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/): $3.99 

 This 2016 remake of the 1993 PC-gaming classic is an outstanding example of how to update a game for modern audiences without losing what made it special. Just like the original, _[DOOM](http://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/)_ is a fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled rampage through a demon-infested planet. This remake, though, ups the ante by forcing you to get up close and personal with your enemies before tearing them limb from limb. It's an absolute blast.

## 14 [Ori and the Blind Forest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/387290/Ori%5Fand%5Fthe%5FBlind%5FForest%5FDefinitive%5FEdition/): $4.99 

 This game is gorgeous. You control Ori, a cute little fox-rabbit thing with all kinds of high-flying abilities you can unlock that let you discover more of his mystical world in this excellent Metroidvania. The occasional break into epic set pieces help make this game so memorable, but it's the heart-wrenching story that truly elevated it for me. If you like it, you'll love the follow-up, [_Ori and the Will of the Wisps_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1057090/Ori%5Fand%5Fthe%5FWill%5Fof%5Fthe%5FWisps/), which is currently $9.89.

## 15 [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/): $4.99 

 At first, [_Terraria_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/) appears to be little more than a 16-bit, side-scrolling version of _Minecraft_ (not that I'd be complaining if that was all it offered). But it's overflowing with quirky additions, seemingly endless crafting depth, and varied play styles. Much like _Minecraft_, it's a game where you form your own adventure, and the huge possibilities presented mean you could enjoy hundreds of hours doing just that. Not bad for $4.99.
