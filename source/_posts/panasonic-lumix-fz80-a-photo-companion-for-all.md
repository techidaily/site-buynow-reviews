 _We purchased the MoKo Universal Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

 The MoKo Universal Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard is an ultra-thin, split ergonomic keyboard. It features a unique 165-degree U-shaped fold that’s designed to promote healthy typing habits. It does this by creating a natural, neutral typing position to relieve pressure on hands and wrists that over time can lead to repetitive stress injuries.

 Thanks to its compact, foldable design, it’s easy to throw in a purse, backpack, or pocket and take along on any adventure, making it an excellent Bluetooth keyboard for frequent travelers. With a general retail price of about $26, we found it to be well worth the investment during a week’s worth of testing.

## Design: Small, Compact, and Light

 Unlike traditional, full-size ergonomic keyboards, the MoKo is small—hardly larger than your hand when folded down to its collapsed size. Extended out, it’s only about a foot in length. It’s perfect for tossing in a purse, backpack,[laptop bag](https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-bags-to-buy-4072282) , or pocket and taking along on any commute or adventure. Better yet, thanks to a convenient magnet along the edges of the frame, there’s no fear of it accidentally opening up and being damaged in transit. The soft-grip back not only offers additional protection but also ensures that it’s not likely to shift on any surface upon which you’re typing. With these combined features, it’s a wonderful little travel companion.

 The one aspect of the MoKo which takes a little getting used to is the 165-degree U-shaped fold. This, combined with its flat, neutral position, encourages healthy typing habits so you’re less likely to get[repetitive stress injuries](https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449) from using it. Typing, for the most part, is a breeze though we did find that the angle made it a challenge to re-learn some of the less-standard keys, particularly those in the upper rows which were less frequently used.

 The MoKo’s charge time is just under two hours and it can support up to 40 hours of uninterrupted work or 30 days of standby time.

 The hotkeys on the keyboard are located on the top row. These include several excellent built-in functions, such as cut, skipping forward or back in multimedia tracks, pausing music, increasing or decreasing volume, opening a new search, and several others. These are easy to use thanks to the function key on the lower-left hand side of the keyboard. One drawback, however, is the blue color used to identify these built-in functions is somewhat difficult to see in low-light conditions.

## Setup Process and Connectivity: Broad Device Compatibility

 The MoKo Universal Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard arrives in a small box with the keyboard itself, a small one-year free warranty card, a pamphlet with setup instructions, and a micro USB charging cable. One piece we wish it included is a stand for smartphones. While it’s compatible with them, it’s not very convenient to type on them without one. We’d highly recommend getting a separate stand if you’re considering this keyboard for a smartphone.

 The MoKo uses[Bluetooth 3.0 technology](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412) to swiftly pair with compatible devices and stay connected within a 30-foot range. Compatible devices include[iPhones](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-and-ios-4781515) , iPads, Android phones, tablets, and Bluetooth-capable desktops. For desktops that don’t already have Bluetooth functionality built-in, it may be worthwhile to pick up a Bluetooth dongle that retails for about $10 online or in stores. Though there’s no reason to use this keyboard in place of a full-size keyboard on a desktop unless you’re having difficulty transitioning between the two.

 We tested this with our desktop computer and with our[Samsung Galaxy](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s-phones-4156903) S10+. The setup process was the same between the two devices. First, we ensured that our desktop and smartphone were Bluetooth enabled. Next, we unfolded the keyboard and pressed the FN and T button to enter pairing mode. A flashing blue light indicated that the keyboard was then ready for pairing. On both our desktop and our S10+, the keyboard quickly turned up under the name “Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard.” We selected it and, just like that, pairing was complete.

 The MoKo is small—hardly larger than your hand when folded down to its collapsed size.

## Battery: Plenty of Juice for Work

 The battery life of the MoKo is easy to fall in love with. The MoKo’s charge time is just under two hours and it can support up to 40 hours of uninterrupted work or 30 days of standby time. One added bonus of the keyboard being rechargeable was that we weren’t dependent upon having batteries when the keyboard inevitably ran out of charge. It also has the added benefit of entering a battery-saving mode after sitting idle for 30 minutes, so if you walk away and forget about it, it won’t continue to run out its charge. Reconnecting is easy, too. Simply press any key and, within 30 seconds or less, it’s ready for use.

## Price: Highly Affordable

 Travel-size ergonomic keyboards generally retail for anywhere from $20-$50\. The MoKo retails for around $27 on Amazon. With its low price point, compact build, excellent portability, and great battery life, it’s well worth the price for commuters and frequent flyers who have limited space.

## MoKo Universal Folding Keyboard vs. Jelly Comb B047

 The main competition for the MoKo Universal Folding Keyboard is the Jelly Comb B047\. Similar to the MoKo, the Jelly Comb is a foldable, Bluetooth keyboard. At its collapsed size the Jelly Comb is slightly smaller than the MoKo at an impressive 5.58 inches, so it’s just as easy to take along on a trip or adventure. It’s compatible with Android, iOS devices, and Windows. It also encourages your wrist to sit at a neutral, flat position, although it doesn’t employ the same U-shaped design as the MoKo.

 One drawback is that the Jelly Comb has a shorter battery life, with customers reporting that it supports shorter trips with a range of 8-14 hours of regular use compared to the MoKo’s 40 hours. It also supports up to 18 days of standby time versus the MoKo’s 30 days. If you’re looking for a longer battery life, the MoKo is the clear winner, but if you’re not a fan of the U-shaped, ergonomic design the MoKo uses, then the Jelly Comb B047 is the keyboard for you.

 Final Verdict

 **A great traveler’s keyboard with a portable design and long-lasting battery.**

 The MoKo Universal Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard is an ultra-thin, split keyboard that packs plenty of bang for your buck. Its U-shaped ergonomic design is comfortable, and with a battery life of up to 40 hours of continuous use or 30 days of standby time make it a great choice for commuters or frequent travelers.
