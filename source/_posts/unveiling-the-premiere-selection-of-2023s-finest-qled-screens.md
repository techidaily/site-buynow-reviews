##  What to Look for in a QLED TV in 2023

 While QLED TVs are essentially [LED TVs with an added layer of quantum dots](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-perfect-pairing-of-podcast-apps-and-android-top-6-recommendations/), they can produce more accurate colors than regular LED TVs. So if you are in the market for a new television, buying a QLED TV makes a lot of sense.

 You can find televisions incorporating a quantum dot layer from Samsung, Hisense, LG, Vizio, and TCL. Identifying a QLED TV is pretty straightforward. You will either find QLED right in the name of a TV or quantum dot technology in its specifications.

 Although quantum dot technology is helpful with color fidelity, there are a few things you should keep in mind while looking for a new QLED TV.

 Unlike [OLED TVs](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/), which have self-emissive pixels, QLED TVs use a backlight, usually LEDs or Mini LEDs, to shine through the display "stack" to produce an image. So to offer deep blacks and a good [contrast ratio](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-laugh-ledger-unveiling-the-best-text-generation-apps/), QLED TVs employ a technology called [full-array local dimming (FALD)](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/) to dim LEDs in the darker areas of a scene. Without FALD, the darker areas in a scene will look washed out. So you want your QLED TV to have FALD for better contrast.

 Additionally, if you play a lot of games and are looking to make full use of the latest generation Microsoft and Sony consoles, [HDMI 2.1](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) support is necessary. It'll allow you to play at 4K and 120fps. The presence of [variable refresh rate (VRR)](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) and [auto low latency mode (ALLM)](https://win11.techidaily.com/turn-the-tide-solving-chrome-file-upload-issues-on-windows-pcs/) also enhances the gaming performance. Similarly, if you watch movies a lot, you want good HDR support, better motion handling, and features like [Filmmaker Mode](https://article-files.techidaily.com/inverting-image-hues-in-photoshop/).

 Check out [our guide on how to buy a TV](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/master-the-remastered-yakuza-3-for-pc-with-these-essential-stability-fixes/) for more information on crucial TV features. Additionally, we have a nifty tutorial that will help you decide the [right TV size for you](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-counter-image-navigation-in-digital-age-a-facebook-guide/).

| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Excellent picture quality               | ✗ No support for DTS audio or Dolby Vision HDR |
| ✓ Good viewing angles                     |                                                |
| ✓ 120Hz refresh rate, four HDMI 2.1 ports |                                                |
| ✓ VRR support                             |                                                |

 Part of Samsung's Neo QLED lineup, the [QN90B](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-Inch-Tracking-Anti-Glare-QN65QN90BAFXZA/dp/B09SBHSNNZ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207577&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774439%2Fbest-qled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) tops our list of best QLED TVs thanks to its impressive picture quality, excellent gaming features, and wide range of size options. The TV houses a [4K](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/) LCD panel with full-array local dimming and [Mini-LED backlighting](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 These features help the TV display inky blacks and provide high [peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/). So the visuals on the QN90B look equally stunning in dark and bright rooms. HDR content also looks great, as the TV can display lifelike colors and supports [HDR10](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) and [HDR10+](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-pathway-to-prosperity-a-graphic-designers-journey/) formats.

 Gamers will appreciate the presence of four HDMI 2.1 ports, VRR support, and the 120Hz panel. The company's Gaming Hub also brings native access to three of the most popular cloud gaming services on the market, including [GeForce Now](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/smileshop-memelore-hub/) and [Xbox Cloud Gaming](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-cinematic-illumination-a-filmmakers-path-to-stunning-colors/). Plus, the TV has a low input lag in Game Mode and a fast response time.

 One feature that separates QN90B from our other recommendations is the company's use of Ultra Viewing Angle technology that gives the TV good viewing angles despite using a VA-type LCD panel.

 In other highlights, the Samsung TV shines at [upscaling](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/your-roadmap-to-mastery-the-ultimate-guide-to-google-podcasting/) and has an easy-to-use operating system. In addition, you'll find all popular streaming services in the company's app store, including the likes of Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+.

 Sadly, the QN90B lacks some features you can find on other TVs. The biggest of them is [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/) support. Being a flagbearer for the HDR10+ technology, Samsung doesn't include Dolby Vision HDR support in any of its TVs. Additionally, the Samsung TV doesn't support DTS audio.

 The [Hisense U6H](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YVWYQM6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207577&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774439%2Fbest-qled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a well-rounded QLED TV that won't cost you an arm and a leg. Despite its affordable price tag, the television offers excellent picture quality and a decent feature set, allowing you to enjoy almost everything you do on it.

 It packs many technologies that were earlier only seen on pricier TV models. For example, it has full-array local dimming, which significantly boosts the 4K panel's contrast. As a result, the U6H can display deep blacks.

 The TV also has a good peak brightness and can [reach almost 600 nits](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/hisense/u6h) in HDR, as marketed by the company. This helps the TV's visual performance when displaying HDR content---and you'll be happy to know it supports Dolby Vision and HDR10+.

 Another area where the U6H excels is upscaling. It has no trouble upscaling lower-resolution content whether you watch a DVD or a cable TV channel. And while all four HDMI ports on the TV are limited to 2.0 class bandwidth, [eARC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/) support passes uncompressed high-quality audio to a soundbar or AV receiver.

 Coming to its gaming chops, the Hisense TV has a low input lag for responsive gaming and supports both [AMD FreeSync](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-from-chats-to-files-the-methodical-approach-to-downloading-fb-video-for-2024/) and [HDMI Forum VRR](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-phone-with-ease-the-3-best-lock-screen-removal-tools-by-drfone-android/). But being a budget television, its refresh rate tops out at 60Hz. Plus, its response time isn't very fast, resulting in motion blur.

 Another issue you'll face with the U6H is narrow viewing angles. So anyone watching the TV from an angle will have to suffer washed-out colors.

 You can buy the Hisense U6H in [50-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhisense-50-class-u6h-series-quantum-uled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv%2F6505541.p), [55-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YVWYQM6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207577&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774439%2Fbest-qled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [65-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YVVQQN5/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207577&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774439%2Fbest-qled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [75-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YVTQ7JJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207577&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774439%2Fbest-qled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) models.

Bargain hunters will love the Hisense U6H. It's affordable but still offers good picture quality, Dolby Vision HDR support, and VRR for gamers.

 The [R655](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7ZXGCVY/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207577&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774439%2Fbest-qled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is arguably the best television in TCL's lineup and is also a great QLED TV for gaming. One of its marquee features is the [144Hz refresh rate](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-upside-down-your-instagram-videos-complete-manual/), which you'll find in only a few TVs. The high [refresh rate](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-guide-sharing-igtv-in-the-world-of-insta-stories/) combined with the included support for AMD FreeSync, [Nvidia G-Sync](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/winchatgpt-setup-guide/), and HDMI Forum VRR results in a smooth and tear-free gaming experience.

 The TCL TV is also fully compatible with the PS5 and the Xbox Series X consoles, except for just one thing. It [can't do Dolby Vision HDR](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/6-series-r655-2022-qled#test%5F11883) when you are gaming at 120Hz. But apart from that can get the most out of both consoles. Plus, gaming on the R655 feels responsive as the input lag is pretty low in [Game Mode](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-much-income-arises-from-each-snapshot-video-for-2024/), and there are two HDMI 2.1 ports to enjoy 4K 144fps or 4K 120fps gaming.

 The TCL R655 has much going for it beyond these gaming features. For example, it has a fantastic [contrast ratio](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-laugh-ledger-unveiling-the-best-text-generation-apps/), high peak brightness, and a wide [color gamut](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/). All this helps the TV deliver solid picture quality and a great HDR experience.

 The presence of Roku TV OS is another positive for this TCL TV as it's one of the simplest TV platforms on the market and runs smoothly.

 However, there are a couple of notable deficiencies in the TV. Like most LCD TVs with a VA-type panel, it has narrow viewing angles, which isn't great if you frequently watch TV with your family or friends. And the R655 has trouble properly [upscaling 480p and 720p content](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/6-series-r655-2022-qled#test%5F112).

 If you are a movie buff, you will enjoy watching them on the [Hisense U8H](https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Mini-LED-Compatibility-1500-nit-65U8H/dp/B0B5YZNZTZ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207577&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774439%2Fbest-qled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Part of the company's [ULED](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/on-demand-content-examination-summary-for-2024/) series, the U8H is an incredible value for money. It punches way above its price tag and delivers a performance that you could earlier only expect with much pricier TVs. This is possible because the Hisense TV has every advanced technology you may want in your TV, from Mini-LED backlighting to HDMI 2.1 ports.

 You'll be impressed by the picture quality of the U8H, as it produces vibrant and lifelike pictures with high brightness and accuracy. And this is valid for both SDR and HDR content. Talking of HDR, you can enjoy Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and regular HDR content on the U8H.

 The Hisense TV is also good at upscaling. So your DVD collection and movies on the cable will look great on its 4K screen. Other features include Filmmaker Mode, eARC support, and a built-in [ATSC 3.0 tuner](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/ai-writing-unmasked-5-must-have-detectors-for-academic-and-corporate-leaders/) for high-resolution broadcasts.

 Regarding software, Google TV is holding down the fort, putting content front and center. It also runs smoothly and has a massive app library.

 The one area where the U8H struggles are viewing angles. Its VA-type panel has poor viewing angles. So if that's important to you, our best QLED TV overall pick is a better option. The [QN90B](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-Inch-Tracking-Anti-Glare-QN65QN90BAFXZA/dp/B09SBG5K25/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207577&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774439%2Fbest-qled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has good viewing angles and delivers comparable performance to the U8H. However, the Samsung TV lacks Dolby Vision support and can't handle DTS Audio.

It's a solid QLED TV that provides an all-around excellent experience in everything that matters to TV enthusiasts or casual viewers.

 Its picture quality is remarkable, and you'll have a great time watching movies, TV shows, and sports on it. Thanks to Mini-LED backlighting, the QN90B can get very bright, which helps it deliver excellent HDR performance and deal with glare in rooms with a ton of ambient light.

 Gaming is another strong point of the Samsung QN90B. Thanks to the included HDMI 2.1 ports and its 120Hz panel, it can take full advantage of Microsoft and Sony consoles. Plus, the low input lag ensures your gaming experience is responsive. If that's not enough, you also get native support for various cloud gaming services, including GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming.

[Tizen OS](https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-beginners-guide-10-best-cartoon-makers-for-web-and-desktop/), which powers the software on the TV, is good, and it has all popular streaming services and apps. Plus, you get excellent upscaling capabilities and good viewing angles.

 The only things you'll miss on the Samsung TV are Dolby Vision HDR and DTS audio support.

 All-in-all, it's hard to go wrong with the QN90B if you want a 65-inch QLED TV. But if the 65-inch QN90B is out of your budget or you're looking to save money, the [Hisense 65U8H](https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Mini-LED-Compatibility-1500-nit-65U8H/dp/B0B5YZJD5V/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207577&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774439%2Fbest-qled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent alternative. Apart from having worse viewing angles than the Samsung model, the Hisense TV delivers similar overall performance and has Dolby Vision and DTS audio support.

### What is QLED?

 QLED or Quantum Dot LED is a type of LCD screen that uses quantum dot technology and LED or Mini-LED backlighting. Quantum dot technology helps QLED displays produce vibrant and lifelike colors. And Hisense, Samsung, Sony, and TCL are some of the manufacturers using QLED displays in their televisions.

### What is Neo QLED?

 Neo QLED is a marketing name used by Samsung to identify its QLED televisions that use Mini-LED backlighting. Neo QLED TVs typically belong to the mid-range or high-end price segment.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What's the difference between OLED and QLED?

 OLED and QLED are two different display technologies used in modern televisions. OLED TVs have self-emissive pixels, which allows them to display inky blacks. But QLED TVs have to rely on LED or Mini-LED backlighting. As a result, they can't display as perfect blacks as OLED TVs. But features like full-array local dimming help QLED displays with black levels and contrast.

### How do you clean a QLED screen?

 Like any other television, you can clean a QLED TV with a microfiber cloth. While a dry cloth is preferable, you can spray some distilled water on the cloth to deal with stubborn stains. Remember, abrasive materials or alcohol-based cleaning agents can damage the coating on the screen.

### Can you lay a QLED TV flat?

 You can lay a QLED TV flat while installing it. But it's not advisable to lay its box flat while transporting. This is because its packaging may or may not have adequate support in that position.
