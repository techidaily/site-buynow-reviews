##  Why Do You Need a Screen Protector for Your iPhone?

 Even the most affordable iPhone is far from cheap. You can get [AppleCare+](https://www.reviewgeek.com/58423/is-applecare-worth-it/), but if your display is damaged, you'll have to go without a smartphone for a while. The easiest way to keep this from happening is either [a case](https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-bringing-anime-characters-to-life-jujutsu-kaisen-for-tiktok/), a screen protector, or both.

 Sure, you could opt for a whole folio-style wallet case that covers the screen, but these increase the thickness of your iPhone significantly. If you have a larger iPhone, your pocket is probably already being stretched to its limit. A screen protector can protect your iPhone 13 without that extra bulk.

 A good screen protector protects a part of your display that a case can't—the [oleophobic coating](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fixing-foneazy-mockgo-not-working-on-honor-x9b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). Apple coats iPhone displays with a special layer to keep skin oils from marring the display. This can wear down over time simply from using it.

 Screen protectors often have their own oleophobic layer, meaning you won't have ugly fingerprints to deal with. More importantly, by their nature screen protectors are also replaceable. If you damage your display or your oleophobic coating wears off, you're headed to an Apple Store. If you damage a screen protector, you just swap it for another one.

 Don't forget the other part of your iPhone that is made of glass, like the camera lens. Damage these, and there go all your fancy photos. Fortunately, we include a tempered [glass camera lens protector](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unveiling-the-secrets-to-dynamic-video-cover-design-in-facebook-space/) here as well, so you can make sure your whole iPhone is scratch-resistant and protected.

| Pros                                          | Cons                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ✓ 9H hardness rating                          | ✗ Included cloth can leave behind lint |
| ✓ Installation tool makes installing a breeze |                                        |
| ✓ Oleophobic coating fights off fingerprints  |                                        |

 When it comes to tempered glass screen protectors, hardness is the key, as this determines how much protection you get. The [Spigen Glas.tR EZ Fit](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-Glas-tR-designed/dp/B095RTJH1M/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is rated at 9H hardness, which is the best you'll see in a screen protector.

 Another feature of the Spigen Glas.tR EZ Fit is the oleophobic coating, which keeps the surface free of fingerprints. The screen protector won't leave a residue on your iPhone screen either, so it'll come off clean when you decide to remove it.

 Positioning a screen protector can be tricky, even if you have extraordinarily steady hands. To make sure the Glas.tR EZ Fit goes on perfectly, Spigen has included an installation frame. Just place the screen protector in the tool, then put your phone inside, display-side down. Perfect alignment and easy installation, every time.

 If you want to protect more than just your screen, you'll probably also want an [iPhone case](https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-bringing-anime-characters-to-life-jujutsu-kaisen-for-tiktok/). Spigen guarantees that this screen protector will work with any of its [iPhone 13 cases](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Armor-Designed-iPhone/dp/B096HGD3BK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), but it should also work with most other case types.

 A screen protector is designed to take damage instead of your phone's screen taking it. This means that over time, you'll need to replace it. Fortunately, Spigen includes two screen protectors in the pack so you can change it out when it's time.

 The Spigen Glas.tR EZ Fit is available for the [iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-Glas-tR-designed/dp/B095RTJH1M/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the [iPhone 13 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-Glas-tR-Designed/dp/B095RQKYH6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and the [iPhone 13 Mini](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-designed-Friendly/dp/B095RQPWVY/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The [Supershieldz Tempered Glass Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-Tempered-Protector-Scratch/dp/B09D9YBDZD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) may be our budget pick, but that doesn't mean that the company skimped on protection. Like our [best overall pick](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/essential-fashion-items-for-sj4000-owners/), the Supershieldz screen protector is made from glass tested at a hardness rating of 9H.

 Screen protectors don't always have the smoothest edges, making using your phone less than comfortable. The Supershieldz screen protector uses what it calls 2.5D rounded edges. This makes sure your fingers or nails don't catch the ends of the screen protector, making the iPhone 13 even more comfortable to use.

 Like all glass screen protectors, Supershieldz's offering is hydrophobic, meaning water won't make it through to your phone's screen. It's also [oleophobic](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fixing-foneazy-mockgo-not-working-on-honor-x9b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), keeping fingerprints off of your screen protector as well as your iPhone's screen.

 Unlike the Spigen, there is no installation tool for the Supershieldz screen protector. That said, the company does provide a link to an instructional video to help you install the screen protector properly.

 You'll pay less for the Supershieldz Tempered Glass Screen Protector than you will for our overall pick, but that's not the only bonus. This comes in a three-pack, meaning you'll keep your phone protected for even longer. We're not sure why, but the version for the iPhone 13 Mini only comes in a two-pack, though.

 The Supershieldz Tempered Glass Screen Protector is available for the [iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-Tempered-Protector-Scratch/dp/B09D9YBDZD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the [iPhone 13 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-Tempered-Protector-Scratch/dp/B09D9YF2K8/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and the [iPhone 13 Mini](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Privacy-Protector-Designed-Tempered/dp/B09GQT5S2B/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| ✓ More touch sensitive than glass screen protectors | ✗ Doesn't protect as much as tempered glass |
| ✓ Easy installation                                 |                                             |

 Not everybody wants a tempered glass screen protector. If you're searching for something even more affordable than our budget pick with a few unique features, consider the [Supershieldz High Definition Clear Shield](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-iPhone-Protector-Definition/dp/B09D9ZRTWR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) screen protector.

 PET screen protectors are less visible than tempered glass options. If you aren't a fan of the look of tempered glass screen protectors, PET is an excellent option. Some people also find they feel a little nicer than glass models, though this will vary across brands and models.

 If the idea of a non-glass screen protector has you thinking of the screen protectors of old, that isn't the case. Those were generally made of TPU, which has a rubbery feel. By comparison, a PET screen protector feels smoother, more like the display on your iPhone.

 Supershieldz uses a Japanese PET film that the company says leaves no residue when removed. PET screen protectors are often easier to install than tempered glass models, though you have to carefully avoid bubbles.

 If you're worried about going through a few screen protectors before you get it installed right, fear not. Not only is the Supershieldz High Definition Clear Shield (PET) very affordable, but you get six of them in a single pack, regardless of which iPhone 13 model you have.

 The Supershieldz High Definition Clear Shield (PET) is available for [iPhone 13 and 13 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-iPhone-Protector-Definition/dp/B09D9ZRTWR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [iPhone 13 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-iPhone-Protector-Definition/dp/B09D9ZPL2J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [iPhone 13 Mini](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-iPhone-Protector-Definition/dp/B09D9Z4FP5/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Whether you deal with sensitive data on your phone for work, or simply want to keep prying eyes away from your text conversations while you're out and about, the [UNBREAKcable Privacy Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09D94T83V?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the perfect way to safeguard your privacy. 

 With its True 20-degree Anti-Spy Protection, the screen display remains visible only to the person using it, leaving any would-be snoopers with just a black display to look at. So if you're sitting in a bar or cafe, or on public transport, you can use your phone with complete confidence. 

 This privacy screen protector offers a 99.99% HD clear display for the user while blocking the view for everyone else, so you won't need to compromise on visual clarity when you use it. Plus, this tempered glass screen protector has a 9H hardness rating and provides six layers of shockproof protection, which is good news, considering the hefty price point. 

 There's an oleophobic coating that protects against fingerprints and smudges, and installation is a nice and simple (and bubble-free) affair. Compatible with iPhone 13, UNBREAKcable also has a version of this screen protector for [iPhone 13 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/UNBREAKcable-Protector-Shatterproof-Tempered-Installation/dp/B0BN5HTP3K?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) users, too. 

 You get two screen protectors per pack, which helps to take a bit of the sting out of the price tag. However, when you consider the freedom you're getting from this anti-spy screen protector, you know that it's money well spent.

 Like our [favorite screen protector](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/essential-fashion-items-for-sj4000-owners/), the [UniqueMe Tempered Glass Camera Lens Protector](https://www.amazon.com/UniqueMe-Compatible-Protector-Scratch-Resistant-Installation/product-reviews/B09B9QZ1RV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) features glass with a 9H hardness rating. This means the other important glass on your iPhone is as protected as the glass that makes up the screen.

 A tempered glass screen protector can cause glare thanks to the camera flash, but UniqueMe has equipped this protector with an anti-glare coating for better nighttime photography. The company also applied an oleophobic layer to ensure you don't ruin a potentially great photo with a fingerprint smudge.

 To ensure you don't trap dust or other debris between the camera lens and this protector, UniqueMe has included wipes. This lets you be confident that your lens is fully clean before applying the protector. There is no installation tool, but given the shape of the camera bump, these are pretty difficult to install wrong.

 UniqueMe's camera lens protectors come three to a pack at a low price. This means that you'll have plenty of cash left over to pair this with a [screen protector](https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-if-your-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-auto-does-not-work-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) to make sure your iPhone is as protected as it can be.

 The UniqueMe Tempered Glass Camera Lens Protector is available in two different versions. One is compatible with the [iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/UniqueMe-Compatible-Protector-Scratch-Resistant-Installation/dp/B09B9QZ1RV/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), while the other is compatible with the [iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini](https://www.amazon.com/UniqueMe-iPhone-Mini-Scratch-Resistant-Installation/dp/B09B9R26XF/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207845&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770059%2Fbest-iphone-13-screen-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).
