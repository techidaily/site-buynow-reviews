##  What to Look For in a Keyboard in 2023

 You might look at the keyboard market today and be a bit shocked at the choices (and prices). A keyboard is more than just a keyboard now, and there's a lot more going on underneath the surface that will affect how it works.

 There are two main types of keyboards---[membrane and mechanical keyboards](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-strategic-sharing-of-tiktok-content-on-twitter/). Membrane keyboards are the type of keyboards you'd see in an office setting. They're named after the membrane underneath the keys that register key presses. These tend to be less expensive and generally basic in terms of feel and features, but they're fine for typical day-to-day office work.

 On the other hand, mechanical keyboards use spring-loaded switches underneath each key instead. These switches give more direct tactile feedback when you're typing, which leads to more accurate keystrokes and a more durable keyboard. Mechanical keyboards are, on average, more expensive as a result.

 Most of our keyboard recommendations will be [mechanical keyboards](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unveiling-the-best-practices-for-crafting-viral-instagram-reels/). While they are typically more expensive, they provide a big upgrade over a membrane keyboard for a more accurate typing experience. If you're set on a membrane keyboard, though, don't worry, as we still have some great recommendations!

| Pros                                      | Cons                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Full-size layout                        | ✗ Expensive                               |
| ✓ Top-notch build quality                 | ✗ Not the quietest keyboard on the market |
| ✓ Hot swappable                           |                                           |
| ✓ Provided keycaps are perfect for typing |                                           |
| ✓ Multiple layers of sound-dampening foam |                                           |
| ✓ Features a removable USB-C cable        |                                           |
| ✓ Includes a volume knob                  |                                           |

 Our best overall pick is the [Keychron Q6](https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Mechanical-Programmable-Hot-swappable-Compatible/dp/B09MMXSFR2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This is a full-size keyboard since that's the most popular keyboard form factor. It's not made for smaller desks, but the added numpad will significantly benefit everyone working with numbers.

 This is a full-size custom [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reviewgeek.com/92845/the-ultimate-mechanical-keyboard-buying-guide/), and it's dazzling. The build quality is top-notch, the keyboard comes with installed switches and keycaps. You've also got multiple layers of dampening foam for a zero-ping typing experience. Another plus is the included volume knob.

 Finally, the OSA keycaps found on the Q6 are brilliant for typing thanks to their sculpted spherical dimples that make it easy to hit the right keys since your fingers naturally cradle inside the said dimples. On top of that, the OSA keycap profile isn't very tall, reducing strain during long typing sessions.

 Like most other mechanical keyboards, the Keychron Q6 isn't the quietest, even when combined with linear or tactile switches. If you need a quiet keyboard, buy some o rings and place them over the switches.

 You can also replace switches since the Q6 is a hot-swap mechanical keyboard, allowing you to [swap switches](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-unmatched-tech-elevation-through-srs-enhancement/) without desoldering them first. Some of our silent switch recommendations include the [Gazzew Boba U4](https://rndkbd.com/products/gazzew-u4-boba-switches?variant=43502586921194) (almost inaudible and ultra-tactile, perfect for writers), [Cherry MX Silent Red](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product%5Flist&c=376), or one of the Gateron silent switch flavors as the [Silent Red](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product%5Fdetail&p=3009) or [Silent Black](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product%5Fdetail&p=3006). Check the [Keychron Q5](https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Mechanical-Programmable-Hot-swappable-Compatible/dp/B09MMX12Z3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) featuring the 96% layout if you want something more compact.

 If mechanical keyboards aren't your thing, look no further than the [Logitech MX Keys](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Advanced-Wireless-Illuminated-Keyboard/dp/B07S92QBCJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This is the best full-size membrane keyboard for typing with sculpted keycaps, stunning industrial design, incredible built quality, metal body, backlight keys, support for both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connection, support for Windows and MacOS, and a rechargeable battery.

| Pros                                          | Cons                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ A keyboard and mouse for just $30           | ✗ Uses batteries                               |
| ✓ One Bluetooth dongle works for both devices | ✗ Serviceable, but doesn't do anything special |
| ✓ Decent build for the price                  | ✗ Mouse is small                               |

 If you just need a keyboard, Logitech makes [a simple keyboard and mouse combo](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-MK270-Wireless-Keyboard-Mouse/dp/B079JLY5M5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that will get the job done. At just $30, the keyboard is surprisingly competent.

 This basic membrane keyboard has a few media buttons and a small but great mouse. That's it!

 That's really it, though. If you want programmable buttons, mechanical switches, or [anything for gaming](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-checklist-for-streamlined-recording-of-virtual-gatherings/), you're going to need to spend a bit more money. This set is competent, but that's all it is. It'll get you through the workday at the office, but you owe it to yourself to spend a little more if you use your PC for anything else.

 Also, unlike most wireless keyboards on this list, you'll need to provide your own batteries to keep the MK270 powered up. The batteries don't drain fast, but it's something to keep in mind if you're planning on picking this one up.

 The [Wooting 60HE](https://next.wooting.io/wooting-60he) is hands-down the best [gaming keyboard](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-12-prominent-oppo-fingerprint-not-working-solutions-by-drfone-android/) on the market thanks to its analog switches. And yes, you can remove the strap. The [hall effect](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/esthetic-alignment-for-online-glamour-content-for-2024/) switches detect the force of the pressure with immense precision. When you combine that with the customizable actuation point, you get a keyboard with switches that can activate as soon as it detects even the slightest downward force.

 For instance, you can set the actuation point at just 0.1mm, which means that you'll press the key with even the slightest movement of your finger. And strafing at just the right time, or a few milliseconds faster than your opponents, can mean the difference between life and death in hardcore multiplayer titles.

 Even better, you can set the actuation point of every single switch separately, making WASD keys ultra easy to press while setting the actuation point of the "Windows" or "F4" key higher, ensuring you won't activate them on accident. Even better, the hall effect keys behave like analog sticks on a gamepad, allowing you to play racing games with your keyboard.

 The cherry on the cake is the rapid trigger feature that resets the switch as soon as you start lifting your finger away from it. This allows for fast direction switches, which can greatly help in fast-paced titles such as Valorant or Apex Legends. Combine all of the gaming features here and you've got a gaming keyboard using, which can, at times, feel like cheating.

 The Wooting 60HE has excellent web-based software that comes with a plethora of features and allows incredible customization. The keyboard's also great for typing since those hall effect linear switches feel like heaven when gaming and typing. This keyboard also features build quality on par with custom mechanical keyboards, which is another massive plus. And yes, you've got RGB backlighting.

 The only major downside here is the price. If this keyboard's too pricey for your budget, look at the [Fnatic STREAK65 LP](https://www.amazon.com/FNATIC-STREAK65-Mechanical-Keyboard-Switches/dp/B09MHXC4JC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This is a 65% low-profile keyboard built for gaming. It doesn't have hall effect switches, but its low-profile switches and a price of about $120 are nothing to sneeze at. The [Ducky One 3 Mini](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/One3-Mini) is another quality choice for gamers who prefer smaller keyboards.

 Wired keyboards might be more popular for gaming, but it's hard to deny the appeal of a wireless setup. If you're looking to streamline your desk and get rid of clunky cables but can't sacrifice your gaming prowess, the [Logitech G915 TKL](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Tenkeyless-Lightspeed-Mechanical-LIGHTSYNC/dp/B085RFFC9Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) should be high on your list of potential purchases.

 The G915 TKL offers both a USB receiver and Bluetooth capabilities for easy connectivity. Your best bet for gaming is to use the USB receiver, as it'll make use of [Logitech's Lightspeed technology](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/lightspeed.html) to offer 1ms response times. Or, if you have multiple computers, you can use the USB receiver to control one device and swap to Bluetooth to control the other.

 Logitech gave the G915 TKL a rather striking design, with either a [black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L8BP9KK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [white](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L8BP9KK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) chassis accompanied by individual RGB lights beneath each keycap. The profile of the keyboard is incredibly thin, giving it a sleek, low-profile look that'll fit nicely with most gaming setups.

 This keyboard is also lacking a keypad, which is a pro or con depending on your needs. If you're an accountant and the keyboard needs to pull double-duty for work, then you might miss the functionality. But if you're strictly using it for gaming, you'll likely appreciate its streamlined appearance.

 If you’re looking for a versatile keyboard that works across multiple devices, look no further than the [Logitech K380 Bluetooth Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-K380-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B0148NPH9I?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Along with a portable design, this keyboard lets you quickly switch between three different devices, making it one of the most versatile products on this list.

 The biggest selling point of the K380 is its Bluetooth connection, which allows it to connect to up to three devices simultaneously. When you want to start typing on a different screen, simply press one of the three input buttons to change your connection instantly. Connections can be made up to 10 meters away—so regardless of your setup, you shouldn’t have a problem with connectivity.

 Logitech sells the K380 in a variety of colors (including [dark grey](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-K380-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B0148NPH9I?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [lavender](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-K380-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B0B8M5FBFQ?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [rose](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-K380-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B08834ZY6X?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [sand](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-K380-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B0B8M9NM56?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)), and all of them feature the same compact shape. This makes it great for travel, though it also means you’re missing out on the number pad. Keys are also rounded instead of the usual square format on most keyboards. It’s a minor quirk and one that most people should acclimate to quickly, but some users will find this design choice less than ideal.

 Ergonomic keyboards are a great way to reduce wrist strain. They’re a great option for folks who spend most of their time at their desk, and ergonomic keyboards don’t get much better than the [Logitech ERGO K860](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Wrist/dp/B07ZWK2TQT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Featuring a wireless connection and split keyboard design, it’s easy to find a comfortable typing position with this well-equipped keyboard.

 While the split keyboard design is what allows the K860 to offer a comfortable typing experience, anyone coming from a traditional keyboard will likely bump up against a learning curve as they acclimate to the new layout. It’s still a QWERTY format, but there’s a large gap between the left and right sides of the board. There’s also a slight curve between your left and right hands. Many ergonomic keyboards use this layout, so it’s not unique to the K860, but it’s something to be aware of before purchasing.

 Beyond that, it’s hard to find many faults. Logitech tosses in a wrist rest with your purchase, the product is certified by United States Ergonomics, and its incline level is adjustable to help find the perfect typing position. Other useful features include the ability to create custom shortcuts, get battery-life notifications, and Function keys for added functionality.

 Tenkeyless (or TKL) keyboards are named as such because they're missing the numerical keypad, similar to many laptop keyboards. TKL keyboards have become more popular lately, as many people don't use the Numpad consistently and appreciate the extra desk space. They've become especially popular with gamers, as the extra room is important for mouse movements.

 The [Logitech G915 TKL](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Tenkeyless-Lightspeed-Mechanical-LIGHTSYNC/dp/B085RFFC9Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a gaming quality TKL keyboard that's one of the best around---in fact, we mentioned it above in our [Best Wireless Gaming Keyboard](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-bring-your-best-movies-from-mmc-to-the-vimeo-universe/) section. The G915 is wireless but offers Lightspeed wireless technology, which is Logitech's way of saying there is little to no input lag.

 You'll also still get dedicated media and volume buttons, which isn't common in the more compact keyboard forms. Logitech's G series also has great-looking LEDs that aren't too bright, straddling the line between a cool gaming keyboard and one that's not overdoing it with the lights.

 The G915 isn't cheap, going for $230 for any of the three models available. Some [Amazon reviews](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3W2PX15KA?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) also mention that they broke their keyboard due to its thinness. However, the G915 is still solid for most gamers---it's just that if you're a more aggressive player, you might want to go for something that can handle key mashes.

 If you're not sure, you can also check out [Review Geek's review of the G915](https://www.reviewgeek.com/45064/logitech-g915-tkl-review-skinny-but-solid/) and see how the G915 stacks up to your needs.

 The [Wooting 60HE](https://next.wooting.io/wooting-60he) wins again, this time in the best 60% keyboard competition. Aside from its insanely good gaming features, this keyboard's also great for typing. Sturdy build quality, in combination with multiple layers of dampening material and factory-lubed stabilizers make it sound better than most other prebuilt mechanical keyboards.

 The switches feature a 60g actuation force, which is on the lighter side and great for everyone who types a lot. The PBT keycaps have that slightly rough-feeling texture, but you can replace them if you want because the switches have the usual Cherry MX-compatible stems.

 Then there's the web-based software that, aside from a bunch of gaming-related features, also allows you to create multiple function layers and change the function of every key separately. Those who can't live without custom mechanical keyboards can unscrew the case and transfer the rest of the keyboard into any 60%-compatible custom keyboard case.

 Since the Wooting 60HE is quite pricey, we'd like to offer a few alternatives. Our previous pick, the [GMMK 60 Percent Compact](https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Mechanical-Keyboard-Tenkeyless-Gaming/dp/B07JBJF3NX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), is still a pretty good keyboard for gaming and typing. Next, you have the [Fnatic STREAK65 LP](https://www.amazon.com/FNATIC-STREAK65-Mechanical-Keyboard-Switches/dp/B09MHXC4JC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which targets gamers. Finally, the [HyperX Alloy Origins 60](https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Alloy-Origins-Mechanical-Compatible/dp/B08XBQ79MN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a superb choice for everyone who doesn't want to spend more than $100 on a 60% keyboard.

Aside from being the best gaming keyboard around, the Wooting 60HE is also an impressive 60% keyboard. Its linear switches are great for typing, multiple layers of sound-dampening foam and factory lubed stabilizers make for a lovely typing sound, and the keyboard's also pretty as a picture.

 Do you need a keyboard to go with your Mac? You'll want to get the [Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-English-Silver/dp/B09BRDXB7N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Apple's keyboard is, of course, specially made for [Mac devices](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/cat5-or-cat6-choosing-the-right-ethernet-cable-for-your-network-needs/), and it'll even automatically connect to your Mac device. No fiddling around with Bluetooth settings with this!

 The Magic Keyboard more than just looks like an Apple device, though---it feels great to type on. The minimalist style is a bit misleading because although it's compact and looks more like a laptop keyboard than a desktop one, it still types wonderfully. If you need a number pad, Apple recently released [a full-size Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Numeric-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B071ZZTNBM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), too.

 This keyboard has a distinct look and feel, but that also means that not everyone will enjoy it. If you're looking for something for gaming or anything more than casual productivity, the Magic Keyboard won't make the cut. It only has the minimum keys to make it a full-fledged keyboard, without any media keys or extra features that even our [budget pick](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-5-must-have-equipment-and-basic-software-to-start-vlogging/) has.

 On top of that, the Magic Keyboard is on the expensive side. Some of our [gaming keyboard picks](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-checklist-for-streamlined-recording-of-virtual-gatherings/) are more expensive, but they also have a lot of extra features---the normal Magic Keyboard is $99 for just, well, a compact keyboard.

 Still, though, if you're a Mac user and you're not doing any heavy gaming, you'll find a lot to love in the simplicity of the Magic Keyboard.

## FAQ

### What is the keyboard shortcut for undo?

 The keyboard shortcut for undo is "Ctrl + Z."

### How do I switch browser tabs using a keyboard?

 To cycle forward through opened tabs in your browser, hit "Ctrl + Shift." To go one tab back, press "Ctrl + Shift + Tab."

 You can cycle through opened tabs by pressing "Ctrl + a number key." For example, pressing "Ctrl + 1" will land you on the starting tab, while pressing "Ctrl + 6" takes you to the sixth tab from the left.

 Note that when you hit "Ctrl + 9" you won't land on the ninth tab to the left but on the rightmost tab opened in your browser, no matter how many opened tabs you have.

### How do I turn on keyboard backlights?

 This depends on your keyboard model. Some keyboards have a dedicated backlight button, others use a combination of keys --- for instance, most use an "Fn + a second key" combo, usually one of the function (F1-F12) keys --- while some keyboards, such as the [Shurikey Hanzo](https://www.amazon.com/Shurikey-Keyboard-Backlit-Wireless-Mechanical/dp/B09K6Z2YBX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209412&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739984%2Fbest-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), have a dedicated backlight knob.

### How many keys are on a keyboard?

 The number of keys on a keyboard varies depending on its form factor:

* Full-Size layout (100%): 103 - 108 keys
* 1800 form factor: 103 - 104 keys
* 96% size (compact 1800 layout): 103 or 104 keys
* TKL (80%): 87-88 keys
* 75% keyboards: 83 or 84 keys
* 65% form factor: 67 or 68 keys
* 60% layout: 61 keys
* 40% keyboards: 45-50 keys

### How do I clean my keyboard?

 If your keyboard has removable keycaps, you can remove and wash them while cleaning the rest of the body with a microfiber cloth.

 If your keyboard's keycaps aren't removable, use a slightly damp microfiber cloth to clean both the keycaps and the rest of your keyboard's body.

 You can get rid of the stuck crumbs by simply turning the keyboard upside and shaking it. For hard-to-reach, caked-on grime, use cotton swabs soaked in alcohol or disposable lens wipes.
