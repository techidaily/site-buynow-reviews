##  What to Look for in a Vertical GPU Mount

 Unless you plan to get a vertical GPU mount specifically designed for your case, the two most important things to pay attention to include the case and GPU support. Even if you have one of the [best PC cases](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/interactive-ai-duo-unveiling-3-approaches-to-chatgpt-and-wolframalliance/) around, it may not be compatible with every universal vertical GPU holder out there.

 And if you own a [Mini-ITX case](https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-stitch-together-photographs-the-montage-masterclass/), getting a vertical GPU mount is out of the question since there’s no universal vertical GPU holder that's compatible with ITX housings. Further, vertical GPU mounts for [micro-ATX housings](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-spark-ars-color-palette-expansion-via-free-accessible-lut-downloads-for-2024/) usually severely restrict your [CPU cooler](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-elevate-youtube-broadcasts-select-the-right-webcam/) height. If you own a micro-ATX PC case, you might need to forego getting a vertical GPU mount unless you cool your CPU with a liquid AIO CPU cooler or a custom [water cooling loop](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/securing-a-seamless-srt-upload-experience-on-social-networks-for-2024/).

 Next up is the GPU compatibility. Most vertical GPU holders come with brackets that can house at least dual-slot graphics cards. The catch here is that many higher-end GPUs feature designs with chunky heatsinks that often surpass dual-slot width. If that’s the case, make sure that the mount you’ve set your eyes on can house your GPU in terms of width.

 Due to their design, every single vertical GPU mount on the market comes with a PCI-e riser cable since you cannot connect a vertical GPU directly to a PCIe slot on your motherboard. Budget-oriented options usually include a PCIe 3.0 instead of a [PCIe 4.0](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-quickcapture-stopping-and-saving-screen-moments/) riser cable, which can result in an issue where the graphics card isn’t sending any video signal to the monitor.

 If you own a PCIe 4.0 GPU and a motherboard with PCIe 4.0 or [PCIe 5.0](https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-saving-smiles-the-ultimate-list-of-twitvid-tools/) slots, the best course of action is to get a vertical GPU mount that includes a PCIe 4.0 riser cable. But if the vertical GPU bracket comes with a PCIe 3.0 riser cable, you'll have to go into your motherboard's [BIOS](https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/experience-the-rotibox-beanie-hat-your-ideal-bluetooth-headset-with-outstanding-comfort-and-clear-sound-quality/) and set your GPU connection to PCIe 3.0 before installing the mount.

 Regarding the designs and unique features, you’ve got vertical GPU mounts with adjustable brackets, [RGB](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-brand-collaboration-on-youtube/) support, and even video port adapters, allowing you to effortlessly hook your video cables to your vertically mounted GPU.

 Another thing worth mentioning is that vertically mounting your GPU decreases [airflow](https://common-error.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-restoring-integrity-of-windows-os-file-system/) around the graphics card. This often results in higher thermals under load, especially if you own an enclosure that’s not very wide. On the flip side, the thermals of liquid-cooled graphics cards shouldn’t be affected when mounted vertically.

 Lastly, if you have the option, always get a vertical GPU mount specifically made for your case over a universal one. Being designed to fit a specific housing makes it much easier to mount and install.

 The [Cooler Master MasterAccessory Vertical GPU Card Holder Kit V3](https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-MasterAccessory-Vertical-Graphics/dp/B0B72D88KL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a versatile vertical GPU mount that has a rugged and tool-less design and an adjustable GPU bracket. The mount also comes with a PCIe 4.0 riser cable and is compatible with virtually every [ATX](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-guide-to-catch-the-regional-located-pokemon-for-oppo-reno-9a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) chassis out there, as well as with most mATX PC enclosures.

 After installing the GPU, the adjustable bracket allows you to move it across the X and Z axes. The latter can improve thermals by allowing you to move the GPU away from the side panel if you’ve got a case with a glass side panel. You can use GPUs with up to three-slot rear I/O design as long as you can fit the said GPU inside your case. This includes virtually every graphics card available at the moment.

 The mount is made of steel and is super sturdy. The included 165mm PCIe 4.0 cable should be long enough for any case, including ultra-chunky dual-chamber designs like the [Lian Li O11 Dynamic](https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-PC-O11-Dynamic-Computer/dp/B09QHJZ7LK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or the [NZXT H6 Flow](https://nzxt.com/product/h6-flow). It's priced just right, too, especially if we take into account that a budget PCIe 4.0 riser cable alone can set you back between $40 and $50.

 It's not all perfect, though. The installation process is fairly complicated, especially when you have to connect display cables. mATX support is also limited since you can use the mount with AIOs, custom loops, or low-profile CPU coolers that are up to 70mm in height. And anyone looking for a splash of color will have to look elsewhere, as Cooler Master doesn’t offer an RGB variant of the mount.

 The [EZDIY-FAB PCIe 4.0 GPU Mount Bracket with ARGB](https://www.amazon.com/EZDIY-FAB-Bracket-Multi-Angle-Adjustment-Compatible/dp/B0BX95Q6F8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a well-built vertical GPU mount packing unique features and [lots of RGB](https://win11.techidaily.com/building-win11-sfx-archives-with-ease/). This mount isn’t as rugged as the Cooler Master one, and you cannot adjust the GPU bracket across multiple axes. But it includes a pretty-looking ARGB implementation along with the ability to tweak the angle of the GPU bracket up to 45° for better airflow.

 The mount supports three-slot graphics cards and features four powerful magnets at the bottom for simple installation without tools. But you will need a screwdriver to secure the adjustable GPU bracket.

 The installation procedure can be a pain, though, mainly because you need to connect the ARGB connector on top of having to install the mount. And if you want to tilt your graphics card, make sure to have a lot of clearance between the side panel and the motherboard. The full 45° tilt requires at least 7.9in/20cm of clearance.

 If you decide to get this mount, don’t forget to finish the installation, including tilting your GPU and connecting the ARGB connector to the motherboard, before connecting the display cables. Also, while EZDIY-FAB states the mount is compatible with mATX cases, the seven PCI slot requirement makes most mATX enclosures incompatible with the mount.

 If you’re looking for a vertical GPU mount that makes connecting the display cable to the GPU easy, the [CableMod Vertical PCI-e Bracket PCI-e 4.0 Edition with HDMI and DisplayPort Adapters](https://store.cablemod.com/product/cablemod-vertical-pci-e-bracket-pci-e-4-0-edition-black-hdmi-displayport-2/) looks like an excellent choice. This mount comes with both an [HDMI and a DisplayPort](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/voicemod-malfunction-solutions-how-to-ensure-seamless-operation-in-2ts-guide/) adapter you can connect to your graphics card before installing it to the mount. After finishing the installation procedure, you can simply connect the display cable to the adapter in just a few seconds instead of trying to hook the cable to the now hard-to-reach video ports on your GPU.

 The build quality is pretty durable thanks to the all-steel design, and the mount is compatible with all ATX cases that come with at least seven PCI slots. The installation procedure is relatively easy compared to other vertical GPU mounts, especially since you can connect the included display adapters to the GPU before slotting it into the mount.

 Another plus is the super long, 210mm PCIe 4.0 riser cable that should allow you to use this mount with the largest and widest PC cases available. GPU compatibility includes all graphics cards with up to three-slot wide rear I/O, which includes most graphics cards, even behemoths like the [ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 4090 Gaming OC](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-GeForce-Gaming-Graphics-DisplayPort/dp/B0BGT61797?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). However, the [RTX 4090 Founders Edition](https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/) isn’t compatible with this holder because its rear I/O shield is a three-slot design.

 While the CableMod Vertical PCI-e Bracket is compatible with most ATX PC enclosures, there are exceptions [listed on Cable Mod’s compatibility page](https://cablemod.com/compatibility/). As for the negatives, the included [HDMI](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-color-space-comparison-srgb-vs-rgb/) adapter is a 2.0 one, [not a 2.1](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-mastering-instagram-boosting-post-engagement-strategies/), meaning it doesn’t support 4K@120Hz mode, which is a huge bummer.

| Pros                | Cons                                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Affordable          | Features a PCIe 3.0 riser cable instead of a PCIe 4.0 one |
| Lots of RGB         | Doesn’t support mATX housings                             |
| Solid build quality | Installation can be a pain                                |

 Budget-oriented buyers should consider getting the [EZDIY-FAB Vertical Graphics Card Holder Bracket with ARGB and PCIe 3.0 Riser Cable](https://www.amazon.com/EZDIY-FAB-Vertical-Graphics-Bracket-GPU/dp/B08R9PDBTD/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Its price is almost half of a high-end vertical GPU mount, but it doesn’t offer any extra features aside from the ARGB LED strip.

 It's well-built, but the installation can get complicated quickly because connecting display cables is unnecessarily difficult due to the rear frame being split into two sections to secure the GPU.

 The included PCIe 3.0 riser cable is 200mm in length, which is sufficient even for super wide, dual-chamber PC cases. But, if you have a motherboard with PCIe 4.0 or PCIe 5.0 slots, you’ll need to enter your motherboard BIOS and set the primary PCIe slot to the PCIe 3.0 mode.

 Compatibility-wise, you should be OK with any graphics card with a two-slot rear I/O design. When it comes to case compatibility, you can install the mount inside any case with seven PCI slots, which includes most ATX designs.

 Our last pick is specifically designed for the following Lian Li enclosures: [O11D EVO](https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-PC-O11-Dynamic-Computer/dp/B09QHJZ7LK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [O11D](https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-PC-O11DW-Tempered-Computer/dp/B07F9TC5W7?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [O11DXL](https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-Certified-O11D-XL-W/dp/B07R4C2YQS?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce),[LANCOOL III](https://www.amazon.com/White-Aluminum-Tempered-LANCOOL-3R-W/dp/B0B467H81C?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [LANCOOL II](https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-LANCOOL-MESH-Mid-Tower/dp/B09MHXH2F1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [LANCOOL 215](https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-Lancool-Tempered-Computer/dp/B09MHX83CR?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and the [Odyssey X](https://lian-li.com/product/odyssey-x/). If you own one of these cases, you're much better off getting the [Lian Li Universal 4- Slots Vertical GPU kit](https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-Universal-Vertical-White/dp/B0C84PKRCZ/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) instead of a universal vertical GPU mount.

 This vertical GPU mount is built like a tank and supports up to four-slot graphics cards. This means you shouldn’t face issues even with the chunkiest GPUs as long as they can fit inside the case.

 The mount kit comes with a 200mm PCIe 4.0 riser cable, which is long enough for every compatible case. You can also pick between black and white variants, but Lian-Li doesn’t offer an ARGB version of the mount.

 Regarding downsides, the rear frame is divided into three sections to help rigidity and prevent the GPU from sagging, but it can be a pain to connect the display cable through very narrow slits. Other than that, this is one slick-looking and well-built vertical GPU mount available at a competitive price.

Best Vertical GPU Mount for Lian-Li Cases

#####  Lian Li Universal Vertical GPU kit

The Lian Li Universal 4- 4-Slots Vertical GPU kit with Gen 4 Riser is the best choice for owners of Lian Li cases compatible with this vertical GPU mount. The thing's built like a tank and features a super-long PCIe 4.0 riser cable. 

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-Universal-Vertical-White/dp/B0C84PJ67Y/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000930&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-vertical-gpu-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

## FAQ

### Is it good to mount a GPU vertically?

 Vertically mounting an air-cooled GPU results in higher thermals under load —read: when playing games— so, in most cases, vertically mounting your GPU will result in it getting warmer under load. On the other hand, a vertically mounted GPU is certainly more pleasant to the eye and won’t get damaged due to [GPU sag](https://common-error.techidaily.com/how-incompatible-drivers-can-compromise-the-integrity-of-your-ftdi-synchronous-data-transmission/). 

 If you own a liquid-cooled graphics card, however, feel free to mount it vertically since its thermals won’t be affected because it doesn’t have [cooling fans](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-next-gen-webcams-top-5-featuring-premium-audio-capabilities/).

### Is a vertical GPU better or worse for airflow?

 In most cases, having a vertically mounted GPU is worse for [airflow](https://common-error.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-restoring-integrity-of-windows-os-file-system/) and will result in higher GPU thermals under load.

### How does GPU sag damage the GPU?

 A heavy GPU mounted horizontally can bend, or “[sag](https://common-error.techidaily.com/how-incompatible-drivers-can-compromise-the-integrity-of-your-ftdi-synchronous-data-transmission/),” downwards due to its weight. This can result in the GPU’s circuit board, PCIe connector, or even the PCIe slot on the motherboard getting damaged due to the overt stress the GPU applies to the circuit board, PCIe connector, and the motherboard’s PCIe slot. The most extreme cases of GPU sag can result in the GPU completely ceasing to work or the motherboard’s PCIe slot getting damaged beyond repair. 

### What is the best way to mount my GPU?

 If your case supports horizontal GPU mounting, the best way to mount your GPU is horizontally. That said, some PC chassis, especially ultra-compact [ITX designs](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-motorola-moto-g84-5g-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), only support vertical GPU mounts. If that’s the case with your housing, you have no other choice than to mount your GPU vertically.
