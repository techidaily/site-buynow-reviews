##  What to Look for in a Bluetooth Adapter in 2024

 Bluetooth adapters come in various shapes and sizes and serve different purposes. Whether you need one for your TV, PC, [Bluetooth keyboard](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-samsung-galaxy-m14-5g-bypass-frp-tools-for-pc-that-actually-work-by-drfone-android/), car, or [Nintendo Switch](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-your-whatsapp-location-is-not-updating-and-how-to-fix-on-samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-tactical-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), knowing the specific use will help you choose the right size and type, though they're all pretty portable.

 The Bluetooth version is important, too. Our recommended adapters range from Bluetooth 4.0 to 5.3\. While a Bluetooth 5.3 adapter can work with older versions like Bluetooth 4.0 and lower, it will be limited to the features of the lower version.

 Make sure to also check OS compatibility, since not all adapters work with every operating system or device. For example, the TP-Link UB500 works with Windows 7, 8.1, 10, and 11, but not Windows 8.

 Consider the size of your space and choose an adapter that offers sufficient coverage. The adapters we recommend cover between 30 feet and 65 feet.

 Finally, think about how many devices you'll be connecting at once. Our featured adapters can connect between two and seven devices simultaneously, but adding more devices can impact performance.

 If you're looking for the best Bluetooth adapter for most people, we recommend the [TP-Link UB500 Bluetooth Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004640&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-adapters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Using the TP-Link UB500 is super easy. Just plug it into a USB port on your computer, and you're all set. It works seamlessly with Windows 8.1, 10, and 11\. If you have Windows 7, you'll need to download the relevant driver from the [TP-Link website](https://www.tp-link.com/en/support/download/ub500). Downloading is free, and the process is straightforward.

 This adapter isn't just for your computer—it also supports PS5/PS4 and [Xbox controllers](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-simple-tale-creation-guide/) when connected to a PC.

In fact, you can connect up to seven devices at a time.

 With a range of up to 65 feet, you can stay connected even if you're moving around your home or space, as long as there aren't any major obstacles in the way. This makes it great for households or offices where multiple people need to connect to Bluetooth devices simultaneously.

 The TP-Link UB500 Bluetooth Adapter is a steal at less than $13\. However, if you want to save more and don’t mind Bluetooth 4.0, we recommend the [TP-Link UB400 Bluetooth Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004640&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-adapters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It costs less than $10 and still delivers high-quality performance like the [TP-Link UB500](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004640&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-adapters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Thanks to its plug-and-play design, installing and setting up the TP-Link UB400 is super easy—plug it into your PC, and you're ready to go. It supports Windows 8, 8.1, 10, and 11\. If you're using Windows 7 or XP, you'll need to download the [free driver](https://www.tp-link.com/en/download/UB400.html) from the TP-Link website.

 Another thing we like about the TP-Link UB400 is its impressive range. Unlike Bluetooth 4.0 adapters that keep you tethered to your PC, the UB400 offers up to 65 feet of coverage, similar to the TP-Link UB500\. Just make sure to disable any built-in Bluetooth on your PC for the best experience.

 While the TP-Link UB400 is mainly designed for PCs, it also supports PS4 and Xbox controllers connected to a PC. Although it is incompatible with Mac, Linux, or TVs, it works with various Bluetooth devices like printers, phones, keyboards, mice, and headsets and can connect seven devices simultaneously.

 We recommend the [YMOO Bluetooth Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/YMOO-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Simultaneously-Headphones/dp/B0BBZZXQTL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004640&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-adapters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) as the perfect choice for anyone streaming TV audio through Bluetooth headphones. With this adapter, you can watch your favorite shows without disturbing anyone else or straining to hear or read the on-screen dialogue, whether at home or on a flight.

 This adapter supports Bluetooth 5.3 and works as both a transmitter (TX Mode) and a receiver (RX Mode). In TX Mode, you can send audio from your TV, PC, or even airplane entertainment systems to your Bluetooth headphones or speakers, ranging from 50 to 100 feet. In RX Mode, you can connect your smartphone to wired speakers or headphones via Bluetooth, ranging from 30 to 50 feet.

 Setting up the YMOO Bluetooth Adapter is a breeze, and it can connect to two devices simultaneously, whether in TX or RX mode, providing a stable connection. Its 400mAh battery offers up to 22 hours of continuous use in TX Mode and 20 hours in RX Mode, and it can even work while charging.

 With support for AptX Low-Latency, you'll experience minimal delay in audio (latency), though this feature requires compatible headphones and doesn't support pairing two AptX Low-Latency devices simultaneously. While it's not ideal for professional audio equipment or AirPods Pro/Max, the YMOO Bluetooth Adapter is a fantastic option for everyday use.

## FAQ

### What is Bluetooth?

 Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows connected devices to communicate with each other over short distances. Modern devices like smartphones, headphones, speakers, keyboards, mice, and even cars, all use Bluetooth technology.

### Should I get a 4.0 or 5.0 Bluetooth adapter?

 Choosing between a Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 adapter really comes down to your needs. Bluetooth 5.0 is more advanced and offers better performance, but both versions are backward compatible with older devices. If you use a Bluetooth 5.0 adapter with a Bluetooth 4.0 device, it will operate at the lower version’s capabilities. If you’re planning to upgrade your tech soon, it might be a good idea to go for the 5.0 adapter. It’ll work with your current devices and be ready for any new tech you get in the future.

### What is the difference between a Bluetooth adapter and a Bluetooth receiver?

 A Bluetooth adapter adds Bluetooth functionality to non-Bluetooth devices, allowing them to both send (transmit) and receive audio signals wirelessly, whereas a Bluetooth receiver is designed to only receive and play auido signals wirelessly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Will a Bluetooth adapter reduce sound quality?

 The impact of a Bluetooth adapter on sound quality depends on the codecs it uses and its data transfer rates. Adapters with Bluetooth 5.0 or 5.3 technology generally offer better sound, connectivity, range, and lower latency than those with Bluetooth 4.0\. So, while a lower version adapter might affect sound quality, a higher version one can actually enhance it.
