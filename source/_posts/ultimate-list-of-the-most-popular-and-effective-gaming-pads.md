##  Picking the Right Gaming Controller in 2023

 Video game controllers have settled into the familiar design many gamers know and love. Sony laid the foundations for the current basic layout with the release of the Dual Analog (and later DualShock) controller for the original PlayStation in 1997\. It was the first to incorporate dual analog sticks, a directional pad, triggers, bumpers, and four face buttons in a single design.

 Many improvements have been made since then, but the general layout has remained the same. This ensures broad cross-compatibility between console families, which is ideal for games that rely on dual analog sticks.

 Modern controllers now incorporate wireless play, motion controls, vibration or haptic feedback, rechargeable batteries, decent build quality, and improved ergonomics. More specialized controllers feature adjustable analog sticks, replaceable components, programmable buttons, additional inputs, and the ability to switch profiles depending on what you're playing.

 Matching your choice of controller to your chosen platform is the most important consideration, especially if you're buying from a third party. We've not yet reached the point of interoperability between platforms, but PC and mobile gamers have many more options in this regard.

 Though it's often the case that the "best" available controller isn't necessarily the one that came bundled with your console, first-party controllers are still good options and shouldn't be discounted. They cost more than budget controllers from off-brand manufacturers, but the build quality and ergonomics are generally of a much higher standard.

 If you're shopping for a primary controller you intend to use daily, it's worth spending a bit more. A quality controller will look and feel better, last longer, and should mean that you're not missing out on features like adaptive triggers or haptic feedback. If you're buying a spare for occasional use with friends, a cheap controller isn't a bad idea since it probably won't get used that much.

| ✓ Ridiculously comfortable                                             | ✗ Doesn't work with PlayStation or Nintendo Switch       |
| ✓ Textured plastic feels great in the hand                             | ✗ Clicky directional pad may not be to everyone's liking |
| ✓ Features a Share button                                              | ✗ No haptics                                             |
| ✓ Works with Xbox, Windows, macOS, iPhone and iPad, Android, and Linux |                                                          |

 Microsoft barely made any changes to the [Xbox Core Wireless Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Core-Controller-Robot-White-one/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205080&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F821238%2Fbest-gaming-controllers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) when launching the [Xbox Series consoles in 2020](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-adjust-macs-captured-screen-storage-place/), and for good reason. The controller that comes with every new Series X and Series S console might just be the most comfortable controller you've ever laid your hands on, and it's compatible with a wide range of systems.

 The latest iteration features a share button, USB-C connection, 3.5mm audio jack, and space for AA batteries or an optional rechargeable battery pack. It's made from a hard-wearing, textured plastic that feels great in the hand, with a "clicky" directional pad that works surprisingly well (though it is a little noisy). Microsoft's controller of choice still has some of the best battery life in the game, delivering up to 40 hours of play.

 The controller is perfect for [Xbox Series and One consoles](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/thrilling-adventures-captured-pro-hero5-and-super-sj7-for-2024/), Windows, macOS, [iPhone and iPad](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-sendtransfer-large-video-files-from-iphone-to-mac/), Android, and even Linux gaming. Buttons can even be remapped on Microsoft platforms using the [Xbox Accessories app](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/xbox-accessories/9NBLGGH30XJ3?hl=en-us&gl=us).

 It's incredibly comfortable to use even over long play sessions, and if you run out of juice, you can connect and power it using a standard USB-C cable. For the best possible experience, grab an [Xbox Play and Charge Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Play-Charge-Kit-USB-x/dp/B08FCXLB8Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205080&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F821238%2Fbest-gaming-controllers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) too.

| Pros                                                   | Cons                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Excellent build quality, feel, and functionality     | ✗ Expensive                            |
| ✓ Adjustable thumbsticks and remappable buttons        | ✗ Due for an update (released in 2019) |
| ✓ Replaceable components you can swap out              | ✗ Lacks a dedicated Share button       |
| ✓ Works with Xbox, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux |                                        |

 If you've got an Xbox One or Xbox Series console and you want the absolute best controller money can buy, take a look at the [Elite Series 2 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Elite-Controller-Starter-Bundle/dp/B082LNJ927?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205080&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F821238%2Fbest-gaming-controllers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) from Microsoft. The Elite Series 2 was first released in 2019 during the Xbox One era but works perfectly well on the new Xbox Series console (though it lacks a [dedicated Share button](https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-the-secrets-of-larger-head-visuals-on-tiktok-videos-3-methods/)).

 Standout features include adjustable thumbstick tension, customizable buttons, programmable paddles on the rear, hair-trigger locks for a competitive edge, and a swanky carrying case. The controller can be charged wirelessly in its case or using the included USB-C cable (though you'll need to supply a rechargeable battery).

 You can swap components to match your play style or replace them as they wear out. In the box, you'll get the controller, a set of six thumbsticks, four paddles, and two different directional pads. You can use your Elite Series 2 controller anywhere an Xbox controller can be used, including on Windows, macOS, and mobile devices.

 If you're looking for something customizable but want to spend a lot less, consider the [8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox](https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Ultimate-Wired-Controller-Windows-x/dp/B01MRXMP9J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205080&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F821238%2Fbest-gaming-controllers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It features two extra back buttons, adjustable stick sensitivity, custom button mapping, and three profiles. Unlike the Core and Elite controllers, there's no wireless functionality.

 Nintendo's hybrid console can be played in handheld mode or while docked. If you're thinking of hooking your console up to a TV for high-resolution play (perhaps [using a portable dock](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-hook-creating-headline-helper/)), you can't beat the official [Nintendo Switch Pro Controller](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpro-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch%2F5748618.p%3FskuId%3D5748618).

 Not only is it one of the most comfortable controllers on the market, but it also includes Switch features like gyroscopic aiming, HD rumble, and support for [Nintendo's Amiibo collectibles](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/seamless-installation-of-hp-officejet-4650-printer-drivers-for-windows-users/). Full-sized analog sticks provide a greater range of movement than those on the Joy-Con, plus you get a proper directional pad, Home and Capture buttons, and larger triggers, bumpers, and face buttons.

 The controller charges over USB-C and features up to 40 hours of playtime on a single charge. There's even a USB-A to USB-C cable included in the box, perfect for plugging into the external USB-A port on the Switch dock. There are no fancy features here which means no adjustable sticks, programmable buttons, or paddles on the back, but it is a comfortable and capable controller.

 Looking for something to replace your Joy-Con controllers in handheld mode? Try the [Hori Split Pad Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Ergonomic-Controller-Handheld/dp/B08FJ7XY3B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205080&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F821238%2Fbest-gaming-controllers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). These larger Switch controllers are suitable for those with larger hands, for longer play sessions, or for anyone who finds Nintendo's official controllers a bit too cramped. They lack features like rumble and gyro controls, but the larger analog sticks and programmable rear buttons make them a better choice for many games.

Best Switch Controller

#####  Nintendo Switch Pro Controller

A full-sized controller for playing Nintendo Switch games in comfort. Larger analog sticks, face buttons, and a proper D-pad put the Pro controller leaps ahead of the Joy-Con in just about every game.

| Pros                                                                               | Cons                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ✓ Compatible with Switch, PC, Mac, Android, and Linux                              | ✗ Not the cheapest controller |
| ✓ Adjustable triggers, customizable mapping, rear paddles, and switchable profiles | ✗ Wired                       |
| ✓ Modern grips and analog sticks for comfort                                       |                               |
| ✓ Premium feel at a more affordable price point                                    |                               |

 A good budget controller can be hard to come by, and what you pick depends entirely on which system you will use it with. We chose the [8BitDo Pro 2 Wired](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NS1C5YQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205080&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F821238%2Fbest-gaming-controllers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) controller as it's fairly system-agnostic. It's a good pick for gamers looking for a wired controller for use on their PC, Mac, Android smartphone, Raspberry Pi, or Linux setups.

 The Pro 2 Wired takes its cues from Nintendo's SNES controller, except with the benefit of ergonomic grips that make the controller more comfortable. Switch owners will be delighted to see a real directional pad and dedicated buttons for their platform (including Home and Capture). The pad also has two good-sized analog sticks in the "PlayStation" position.

 While cheaper controllers are available, the Pro 2 Wired is around half the price of an official first-party offering like the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. It features a premium feel and sought-after features like rear paddle buttons, adjustable triggers, custom mapping, a turbo function, and switchable profiles. Xbox owners might be interested in the [Pro 2 Wired Controller for Xbox Series X](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5K93ZN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205080&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F821238%2Fbest-gaming-controllers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) instead.

## FAQ

### How do I clean a gaming controller?

Use a damp cloth with mild soap, or an alcohol wipe to [clean your controller](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-crafting-dynamic-collab-videos-with-content-partners-on-youtube/) of fingerprints or grease. If you think something got stuck under a button, you can attempt to use canned air to try to remove it. You can also take the controller apart to clean it, but this is not necessary in most cases and can void any warranty for replacement.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Are wired controllers better for gaming?

Technically, wired controllers are better for gaming as they don't encounter any connectivity issues that wireless controllers might have, and they don't require charging. However, wireless controllers offer a lot of convenience by being untethered, and connectivity issues are not as common as they used to be. It's best to choose based on personal preference rather than determining which one is objectively better.

### Do headsets plug into a gaming controller?

Some headsets can be plugged into certain controllers, but it's not guaranteed that all headsets will work with all controllers. For example, Xbox Core Controllers can have headsets with an AUX cable plugged into them. However, a headset that connects via USB cannot be used with the controller. Before making a purchase, double-check which headsets can be used with a specific controller, if this feature is important to you.

### How do I connect a gaming controller to a PC?

It depends on the controller. For many controllers, such as the [Xbox Core Controller](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/could-ai-powered-chatgpt-become-a-tool-for-online-criminals-to-access-your-savings-or-devices/) or [Switch Pro Controller](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-downgrade-iphone-6s-plus-without-losing-any-data-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/), it can be as simple as plugging it in via a USB cable or connecting it via Bluetooth. Other controllers may require firmware or software installation, but most controllers will work on a PC with minimal hassle. However, always ensure that the controller you choose can be connected to your PC before purchasing, especially if this feature is important to you.
