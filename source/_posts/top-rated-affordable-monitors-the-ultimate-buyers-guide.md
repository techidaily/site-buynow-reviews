##  What to Look For in a Budget Monitor in 2023

 Shopping for a budget monitor is often a case of balancing quality and features. You don't necessarily need to settle for bad products, but you have to decide which features and specifications are most important to you after you set your budget.

 For most, image quality is the most important factor in choosing a monitor. You may find that panel quality can suffer slightly at the cheapest end of the spectrum, but you don't necessarily need to give up on having a high-resolution display if that's what's most important to you.

 Unfortunately, you likely won't be able to have both high resolutions and high [refresh rates](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/top-11-solutions-to-locate-missing-airpods-on-find-my-apple-feature/), so you should decide which is more important to you. Your monitor's refresh rate measures how many times the monitor updates in a second, measured in hertz (Hz). Higher refresh rates can lead to [better results in online games](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-professionals-playbook-merging-srt-captions-into-mp4/) and a [smoother overall desktop experience](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-find-your-lava-agni-2-5g-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 Gamers on a budget might want to consider what their PC is capable of when shopping for a monitor. If you can't get satisfactory frame rates at 4K (even with [upscaling technologies like DLSS](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/add-music-in-premiere-pro-for-2024/)) you are better off settling for a lower-resolution display with a faster refresh rate for a smoother and more responsive gaming experience.

 HDR performance may also suffer since cheaper displays won't be able to sustain the [peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/) required for a dazzling HDR experience. But these monitors should be plenty bright enough when displaying SDR content, which means they'll be fine for use in a bright room.

[Variable refresh rate (VRR)](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) features are fairly common nowadays, especially since AMD made FreeSync a royalty-free standard. If the monitor lacks HDMI 2.1, you won't be able to use HDMI Adaptive-Sync—which means no VRR support for the PlayStation 5\. This won't be a deal-breaker for everyone, but something to keep in mind if you're planning on playing your PS5 on the monitor.

 Connection options across the board may be slightly more restrictive on budget monitors. You might find DisplayPort over USB-C (with USB Power Delivery) for connecting and powering a laptop with a single cable, but most budget monitors have DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0b instead.

 Regarding aesthetics, you may compromise on the finish and take a slightly chunkier display than those found at higher price points. This may mean thicker bezels for a less modern look, and don't set your heart on anything other than a plastic finish for the rear or monitor stand. Fortunately, this doesn't affect the monitor's performance in the slightest.

 Budget monitor options that come with an inferior stand that lacks good ergonomics and looks ugly can be solved with an [inexpensive monitor arm](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-some-reliable-ways-to-get-pokemon-go-friend-codes-for-honor-x9b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

##  Best Budget Monitor Overall: [Dell S2721QS](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-S2721QS-Ultra-Thin-DisplayPort-Certified/dp/B08DQWG3JG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202992&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F864287%2Fbest-budget-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

Dell

| Pros                                                      | Cons                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| A 4K monitor that won't break the bank                    | Limited to a refresh rate of 60Hz |
| Great image quality and overall brightness in SDR content | Lacks USB-C and power delivery    |
| Great ergonomics and thin bezels                          | Disappointing HDR performance     |
| FreeSync is a nice bonus                                  |                                   |

 The [Dell S2721QS](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-S2721QS-Ultra-Thin-DisplayPort-Certified/dp/B08DQWG3JG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202992&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F864287%2Fbest-budget-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) continues to be one of the best budget monitor choices on the market. It's not the cheapest monitor you can buy, but it strikes an excellent value between image quality and price.

 It features a 27-inch 4K ([UHD](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/)) panel with a resolution of 3840x2160, which translates to a respectable pixel density of 163 ppi. This panel is limited to a refresh rate of 60Hz, which is fine for most desktop and creative tasks but one that will disappoint gamers. Despite this, the S2721QS has FreeSync support, so it could be a good choice if you enjoy casual gaming on the side.

 Though the monitor can take and display an HDR signal, don't expect much in terms of peak brightness, which tops out at about 380 nits. Connection is made using one of the two HDMI 2.0b ports or a single DisplayPort 1.4 port.

 The included stand is fully adjustable with tilt, pivot, swivel, and height adjustment. Alternatively, you can attach a monitor arm to the VESA 100x100 mounting point.

 In terms of aesthetics, we love the thin bezels on the S2721QS, though the monitor has a fair bit of depth to it at the back. Since it's not the thinnest monitor around, make sure to keep that in mind when considering desk space, especially if your desk is against a wall.

 If you're after a budget monitor that packs in the pixels and don't mind sacrificing fast refresh rates, USB-C connection, and 'true' HDR, then this might be the perfect wallet-friendly choice.

 Have you heard that [1440p is fast becoming the new 1080p](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/professional-tips-for-perfectly-recording-your-powerpoint-sessions-for-2024/)? The resolution of 2560x1440, also known as QHD or WQHD, is seen as a midpoint between 1080p resolution and 4K. If your PC is capable of satisfactory frame rates at 1440p, then now is an excellent time to move up, and the [Gigabyte M27Q](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JWCHR5N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202992&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F864287%2Fbest-budget-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) might be the best-value option out there.

 The M27Q provides a sizeable leap in resolution over 1080p and comes with a fast 170Hz refresh rate. The added headroom in refresh rate means you can use frame rates of up to 170 frames per second, which should give you an edge in multiplayer shooters compared to the 60Hz standard.

 This flat (non-curved) Gigabyte monitor uses an [IPS panel](https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-great-debate-final-cut-pro-vs-lumafusion-for-video-editing/) with wide viewing angles, great color reproduction, excellent contrast ratio, and better pixel response times than [VA-type panels](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-youtube-management-by-studio-techniques/). It also has FreeSync Premium support for variable refresh rate gaming, a [KVM switch for quickly moving between computers](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-ispoofer-is-not-working-on-nokia-c300-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), and HDR400 support.

 The tilt and height-adjustable stand have a relatively small footprint, and the monitor has thin bezels and sharp looks without leaning too far into gamer aesthetics. You can hook it up to your computer or consoles with the included dual HDMI 2.0b ports or a single DisplayPort 1.2 port.

 If your PC isn't ready for 1440p gaming, consider the [Asus Nitro XF243Y](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Facer-nitro-xf243y-pbmiiprx-23-8-full-hd-ips-monitor-with-amd-radeon-freesync-165hz-2-x-hdmi-2-0-ports-1-x-display-port%2F6425559.p%3FskuId%3D6425559) instead. This Full HD (1080p) monitor has a 23.8-inch screen and 165Hz refresh rate. It will take up less space on your desk than many of the other options on the list, and the smaller panel size helps to make the loss in pixel density you experience at 1080p less noticeable.

 The XF243Y has fast pixel response times, virtually imperceptible latency, and is ideal for HD gaming. It has FreeSync VRR support, a stand with tilt swivel and height adjustment, and it's dirt cheap to boot.

 The [Samsung ViewFinity S50GC](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-ViewFinity-Ultra-WQHD-Borderless-LS34C502GANXZA/dp/B0C1KPXPM9/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202992&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F864287%2Fbest-budget-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a mainstream ultrawide monitor that strikes a good balance between being an affordable productivity screen and offering good features for entertainment and gaming use cases.

 The Eye Care feature, for example, is clearly aimed at people working in offices with variable lighting conditions. There's a sensor on the screen that automatically adjusts brightness to limit eye strain. Likewise, with two HDMI 2.0 inputs and a DisplayPort 1.2 port, you can attach multiple sources. Even better, you can display two sources at once, either via Picture-By-Picture or Picture-In-Picture.

 As a 100Hz monitor, the ViewFinity offers a much smoother experience than your typical 60Hz office monitor and includes [AMD FreeSync](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-from-chats-to-files-the-methodical-approach-to-downloading-fb-video-for-2024/), which allows variable refresh functionality with a wide range of GPUs while gaming, not just those from AMD.

 One budget compromise worth mentioning is the stand, which is very basic. On more expensive business-oriented ultra wides, such as those from Dell, you'll get height and rotation adjustment. Thankfully, the ViewFinity supports 100x100 [monitor mounts](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-some-reliable-ways-to-get-pokemon-go-friend-codes-for-honor-x9b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 This uses a VA panel rather than IPS, which means you can expect great contrast and deep blacks, but slightly worse viewing angles, motion clarity, and colors. If you do work that relies on an accurate, color-calibrated display, perhaps look elsewhere. For everyone else looking for a jack-of-all-trades ultrawide at a phenomenal price, this is hard to beat.

LG

| Pros                                  | Cons                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| IPS panel with great color accuracy   | 60Hz refresh rate             |
| Built-in KVM                          | Unsuitable for serious gaming |
| Good for casual gaming alongside work |                               |
| USB-C with 90W Power Delivery         |                               |
| Height and tilt adjustable stand      |                               |

 In most cases, having a curved monitor really isn't that useful as a feature. But when we're talking about monitors over 30 inches, especially a 34-inch screen like this [LG 34WQ73A-B](https://www.amazon.com/LG-UltraWide-Computer-34WQ73A-B-Compatibility/dp/B0B924GWLJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202992&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F864287%2Fbest-budget-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), having a subtle curve can make the screen more comfortable to use and ensure that the pixels at the edge of the screen are angled towards you in an optimal way.

 While this monitor isn't designed for gaming and lacks a high refresh rate and variable refresh technology, content creators and other professionals should be perfectly happy taking a break to play modern games at 60Hz.

 Another cracking feature is the built-in KVM, which allows you to control two computers using a single mouse and keyboard. The two computer display outputs are split on the screen using LG's Dual Controller feature. We also like the 90W USB-C Power Delivery connection on the LG, which means you can connect a laptop with a single connection. The screen includes a "productivity hub" with USB-A and network connections for peripherals and the internet.

 The IPS panel is color-accurate and suitable for photography, video editing, or any other visual work where color matters. Even better, the monitor has an ergonomic height-adjustable stand with tilt, so it's ready to go for almost any workspace. Even if you don't particularly care about the curve, the 34WQ73A-B is a great monitor at this price.

LG

| Pros                                             | Cons                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 32-inch 4K (UHD) monitor at a decent price point | Underwhelming HDR                     |
| Vivid VA panel with excellent contrast ratio     | Poor ergonomics on the included stand |
| FreeSync support                                 |                                       |

 There are other monitors on this list that are 4K models, and they're great choices if that's your preference. But if you want something a little bigger and you don't mind giving up a barely noticeable amount of pixel density, the [LG 32UN500-W](http://www.amazon.com/LG-32UN500-W-Compatibility-Virtually-Borderless/dp/B08FPLLX6Y?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202992&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F864287%2Fbest-budget-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) might fit the bill. It's a 32-inch 4K (UHD) monitor with a 60Hz refresh rate, VA panel, and FreeSync support.

 LG's monitor is a good choice for mixed usage, especially if you are squinting too much when it comes to 27-inch models. The VA panel means good color reproduction and contrast ratio, but viewing angles and pixel response times aren't the best (rated at 4ms GtG using overdrive). Like any monitor on this list, you can use it to play games, but the LG 32UN500-W isn't necessarily the best display for the job.

 The monitor can accept an HDR signal but don't expect much in terms of peak brightness. Make use of dual HDMI 2.0b ports and a DisplayPort 1.2 port for connecting your computer or consoles. The included stand is limited to tilt adjustment, so there's no height adjustment or pivot. Fortunately, you can mount the monitor on an arm using the VESA 100x100 attachment to get around this limitation. There's also a more expensive version of this monitor that offers height adjustment, but the price difference does not justify the upgrade, in our opinion.

 Most of the monitors on this list will work fine with a Mac assuming you have the right input (HDMI) or aren't [too annoyed by dongles](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-beyondbasics-futurecameraspost-mycam/). With that in mind, we're stretching the definition of "budget" here to include an affordable monitor that utilizes the USB-C standard to make powering and connecting a MacBook as simple as possible.

 Ultimately, which monitor you choose depends on what you need, but we've settled on the [Dell S2722QC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DTDRJWP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202992&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F864287%2Fbest-budget-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) as a general budget Mac monitor recommendation. This 27-inch 4K monitor is a sleek and simple display that connects via USB-C (with optional dual HDMI 2.0b inputs) and provides 65W of USB Power Delivery (USB-PD), allowing it to comfortably power an M1 or M2 MacBook Air or similar.

 The panel hits around 350 nits of brightness—perfect for use in a bright office—with 178-degree viewing angles that make it easy to share ideas with coworkers. The included stand offers tilt, swivel, pivot, and height adjustment, and you even get a set of integrated 3W speakers.

 Though the monitor isn't built for gaming (with its 60Hz refresh rate and advertised 8ms pixel response time), there's FreeSync support for variable refresh rate gaming with an option to [engage overdrive to counteract any ghosting](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-finest-lineup-top-7-aim-focused-titles/) you might encounter in fast-paced games.

 If you've got a spare couple of hundred dollars in your back pocket, and you fancy something a little nicer, you can opt for the [Dell U2723QE](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TQZP9CL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202992&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F864287%2Fbest-budget-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) instead, which features faster response times, a refresh rate of 75Hz, a brighter screen, a higher quality panel, and up to 90W of USB-PD.

## FAQ

### How do I clean a computer monitor?

 You should always consult your manufacturer's instructions when cleaning your display. Most of the time, cleaning involves using a soft, dry cloth to remove dust or even canned air. Other times you may need to use moisture to remove stubborn grime. For best results use distilled water and a microfiber cloth. There are also specially designed cleaning products designed for use with sensitive display surfaces.[Learn more about cleaning a TV or monitor](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-top-10-capture-cards-for-youtube-you-should-know/).

### How do I measure a computer monitor?

 The correct way to measure a monitor (or TV) is diagonally from corner to corner, to get its size in inches.

### How do I dispose of a computer monitor?

 You can list your monitor for sale on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or another classified site if it is still in working order. Even an old monitor will be of use to someone, so don't write it off just because you have no use for it. If the monitor is "dead" or not working as intended you can recycle it responsibly at a local recycling center, a retailer like Best Buy, or through manufacturers like Apple. [Learn more about recycling old computers and monitors](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-vpna-to-fake-gps-location-on-realme-gt-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

### Do computer monitors have speakers?

 Some monitors include speakers, while others do not. You'll need to carefully read the product description to determine whether or not a monitor you're interested in buying includes speakers. Even if a monitor does have built-in speakers, the sound quality is likely to be poor ([which is also the case on many new TVs](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/avigating-common-youtube-short-glitches/)).

### Can a computer monitor be used as a TV?

 You can use a computer monitor to stream TV shows using a web browser, play movies and video files you have downloaded, or use a streaming device like an Apple TV or Google Chromecast as long as the monitor satisfies[HDCP requirements](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-facebooks-vibe-todays-hot-ten-music-clips/).
