##  What to Look For in a Lap Desk in 2024

 At the top of your list of criteria should be comfort, since the very raison d'etre of a lap desk elevates the ease of laptop use when a standard desk is out of reach. The best choice is usually a padded desk that sits gently on your lap, forming a soft barrier between your thighs and the desk's rigid surface.

 Next, consider the size and fit of the lap desk. The ideal option would provide a snug platform for your laptop, with a little extra space for peripherals such as a mouse or smartphone. It should also rest comfortably on your lap without feeling too cumbersome.

 Mobility is another important aspect. For those constantly on the move, a lightweight, foldable lap desk, preferably with a handle for convenient transport, would be ideal. Remember that while portability is a boon, it often means sacrificing other conveniences like built-in storage compartments.

 Choosing a lap desk with a cooling mechanism may be a good idea if your laptop produces a lot of heat. Ergonomics should also weigh into your decision. A lap desk with adjustable height and tilt capabilities can ensure a comfortable typing position and reduce the risk of neck strain.

 Lastly, consider those little extras that make a good lap desk great. These small but significant touches can be the icing on the cake, from an integrated mouse pad, wrist rest, and slots for your tablet or phone to additional storage space for your other tech tools.

 Finally, you might notice a lot of LapGear products in this list. While we considered multiple products for each category independently, more than a few LapGear desks made their way to the top at the time of writing. This may change in the future as we update this roundup.

| Pros                                           | Cons                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Extra storage options                        | ✗ The microbead cushion might lose shape over time |
| ✓ Clean design                                 |                                                    |
| ✓ Variety of designs for the microbead cushion |                                                    |

 The [LapGear Designer Lap Desk](https://www.amazon.com/LapGear-Designer-Desk-phone-holder/dp/B07N9L5FJJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU227966&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893452%2Fbest-lap-desks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is not just another pretty face in the crowd of home office accessories. It's large enough to fit a 15.6-inch laptop and yet remains small enough to be highly portable. You get a handy phone slot, an elastic band for notes or papers, and a built-in ledge to keep your devices from sliding. The desk also sports a soft microbead cushion, offering stability and comfort for your lap.

 Of course, it's not perfect. Some people have [reported minor issues](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R41TFOOCEO9XF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU227966&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893452%2Fbest-lap-desks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), such as the corners of the desk peeling off. However, these issues seem to be outliers and not the consensus. The majority of customers have given the product high marks.

 Ultimately, the LapGear Designer Lap Desk is a stylish and practical solution for those who value comfort and portability. It's lightweight, easy to carry, and offers an array of patterned fabric designs and wood-inspired surfaces to match your style.

 It's a solid choice for daily use in various settings—home, office, or on the go. While it's not the best at any one thing, this is the easiest lap desk to recommend to anyone.

For example, customers have mentioned that the desk is perhaps a little [too compact](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MFCSIVUX6RMP/ref=cm%5Fcr%5Fgetr%5Fd%5Frvw%5Fttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B076DPT7WD&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU227966&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893452%2Fbest-lap-desks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), or that the deck flexes more than they'd like. While others think it's [pretty sturdy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U5LPR3VYQ8Y0/ref=cm%5Fcr%5Fgetr%5Fd%5Frvw%5Fttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B076DPT7WD&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU227966&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F893452%2Fbest-lap-desks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), all things considered.
