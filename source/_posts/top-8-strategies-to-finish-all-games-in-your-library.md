 Last year, I decided to tackle my greatest sin: my gaming backlog. My library was full of unfinished gamesâ€”some of them I'd never even installed. That pile kept growing out of control as I bought the latest releases. I wanted to play all these games, but how?

 I got serious and employed various techniques to help me clear my pile of shame. While I'm not yet at zero, I've reduced my backlog massively and had a wonderful time doing so, diving into all sorts of different games and getting satisfaction as I check off each one.

## 1  Organize Your Backlog 

 Your first task is to identify your backlog. The simplest way to do this is to manually sort your games into folders. You can likely do this no matter your platformâ€”Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and Steam all support user-created folders.

 I opt for a basic structure: to complete, complete, and never-ending. Everything unfinished sits in the "to complete" folder, before moving to "complete" when done. "Never-ending" is for games that don't have an end goal and therefore aren't part of my backlog, like _Rocket League_ or _Fortnite_.

 If you want greater management, there are services like [Backloggery](https://www.backloggery.com/), [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/), [Completionator](https://www.completionator.com/), [Grouvee](https://www.grouvee.com/), and [GG](https://ggapp.io/). These are particularly handy for tracking multiple platforms in a single place and typically have social features like reviews. My favorite is [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/), which tells you how long it will take to complete your backlogâ€”perfect for when I'm seeking a game I can beat in a weekend, for example.

## 2  Stop Buying More Games 

 An important tip for beating your backlog is to stop buying more gamesâ€”the more you buy, the larger your backlog. That sounds obvious, but it's very tempting to mindlessly buy when platforms like Steam host big seasonal sales.

 The secret is, games always go on sale. It doesn't matter if you miss a sale, since another will be round the corner and the game you want will probably be even cheaper.

![Steam same sales on a computer screen.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/52781215421_eac2d519e5_k.jpg)

 The exception to this rule is for [games that are being delisted](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-showdown-of-projectors-and-tvs-in-a-4k-setting/). This happens for various reasons, like license expirations. If a game you want to play at some point is being removed from storefronts, grab it while you can and add it to your backlog.

## 3  Play a Few Games at a Time 

 Constantly flicking back and forth between lots of games is an inefficient way to beat your backlog because you'll end up feeling like you're not making any progress. Plus, if you're anything like me, you'll spend too long away from a game that by the time you jump back in you've forgotten everything.

 Instead, stick to a few games at a time to keep your focus. You don't necessarily have to only play one at a time, since your mood is bound to dictate what you want to play, but don't have your entire backlog available. Instead, have only the games you're actively playing installedâ€”once you complete a game, remove it and install a new one.

## 4  Explore Different Genres 

 You're unlikely to only ever watch comedy movies or eat the same cuisine every night, so apply the same logic to your backlog. It's easy to get burned out if you play games of the same genre back to back.

 Variety is the spice of life. When you finish a racing game, tackle a platformer next. Once you're done with that, move to an RPG. This way every experience feels fresh and your backlog won't all blur together.

## 5  You Don't Need to Get 100% 

 Set your own definition of what it means to "complete" a game. For some people, that might mean beating every side quest and unlocking all the achievements. For others, it's seeing the main story path to the end and watching the credits roll.

 You don't even need to beat the game. If you've seen everything you want and it's becoming a slog, move on. There are so many games to get through and so little timeâ€”focus on the ones you actually enjoy.

## 6  Lower the Difficulty or Consult a Walkthrough 

 Beating a hard game is an accomplishment, but it's not for everyone. There is no shame in lowering the difficulty or consulting a walkthrough if you get stuck (an [awesome PS5 feature](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-link-length-limit-check-out-these-5-youtube-minisizers/) is Game Help, which offers real-time hints).

 Don't give in easily, mind, since it's satisfying to solve a mind-bending puzzle or defeat a tricky enemy by yourself, but don't let it ruin your enjoyment either. It's better to beat a game and remove it from your backlog than it is to get stuck and give up in frustration.

## 7  Use Portable Devices to Game on the Go 

 You don't need to be tied down to your desk or couch to game, providing you have the right gear.

 While I love gaming on my PC, it means sitting in the same chair I'm in all day for work, which isn't ideal. Purchasing a [Steam Deck revolutionized my gaming habits](https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-about-poco-m6-pro-4g-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/) because I can crack through my Steam library wherever I am. Progress syncs between my Steam Deck and my PC, so I can play while traveling and pick up right where I left off when I get home.

![Person's hands holding the Steam Deck and playing a game, with a fireplace in the background.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/52675437708_14622460f8_o.jpg)

 And of course, the Nintendo Switch is specifically designed to be played anywhere, so you can defeat Mario and Zelda from your backlog while stuck in a waiting room.

## 8  Remember That Gaming Is Meant to Be Fun 

 If completing your games starts to feel like a grind, take a break. They'll all still be waiting for you, ready to play when you feel reinvigorated. It's helpful to explore a different activity for a while, perhaps away from a screen.

 Remember, gaming is meant to be a fun hobby, not a chore. Maybe ditch the term "backlog" entirely, since this has negative connotations and makes it sound like you're checking boxes rather than playing; instead, consider your uncompleted games as a barrel of untapped entertainment.
