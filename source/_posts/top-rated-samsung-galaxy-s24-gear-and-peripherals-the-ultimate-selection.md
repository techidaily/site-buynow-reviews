## Top-Rated Samsung Galaxy S24 Gear and Peripherals: The Ultimate Selection

The Samsung Galaxy S24 is fresh out of the oven and if you bought one, you’ll need at least a couple of accessories for it considering the selling package only includes a USB-C cable. Here are the best ones.

##  What to Look for in Galaxy S24 Accessories

 The only accessory pieces you’re getting with the [Galaxy S24](https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-android-video-editors-for-chromebook-top-recommendations/) are a [USB-C](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-lenovo-screen-capture-tools-effortlessly/) cable and a SIM cover ejection pin, meaning you’ll have to at least [get a charger](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/freedom-in-viewing-is-vlc-more-powerful-than-mpc-for-2024/) if you already don’t have one.

 When shopping for a charger, unless you buy an official charger from Samsung, make sure the charger you end up with supports the Programmable Power Supply (PPS) feature. PPS is an optional part of the [USB PD protocol](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-historys-heaviest-battles-rts-review-of-7-epic-games/), and it allows the charger to supply variable voltage and amperage to the device it’s charging.

 And since Samsung devices feature unique USB PD profiles not supported by the majority of third-party chargers, most third-party chargers that support USB PD but do not come with PPS will deliver only up to 18W of power to your phone instead of 25W, the max charging power the Galaxy S24 supports.

 Next, when it comes to [USB-C cables](https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/), you’ll be alright with a USB-C charging cable that tops out at 3 amps since the Galaxy S24's 25W fast charging profile stays below 3A. If you need a cable for multiple devices, I recommend getting a 6A cable.

 Earbuds-wise, Galaxy S devices work best with Galaxy Buds. All current Galaxy Buds flavors—the [Galaxy Buds2](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight-Graphite/dp/B094242FV1?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the [Galaxy Buds2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Conversation-Resistant/dp/B0B2SFVRC2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and the [Galaxy Buds FE](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Bluetooth-Wing-Tip-Assistant/dp/B0CF7GYNW2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)—have pretty good sound and respectable battery life, making them solid choices for every Android phone owner out there, not only Samsung Galaxy phone owners.

 As for the wireless charger, ensure you get one that supports Galaxy phones and tops out at 10W or more. Note that only a few wireless chargers can deliver 15W to Galaxy phones, the maximum amount of power supported by Galaxy phones, and they’re all quite pricey.

 Next, a 10,000mAh power bank should be enough for most, and you should get almost two full charges from it. Regarding screen protectors, I advise everyone to get one that comes with an installation kit because installing a screen protector without one can be a pain.

 Okay, now that we’ve covered all that, let me show you the best accessories for your Samsung Galaxy S24.

_Samsung_

| Pros                        | Cons                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Great sound               | ✗ The Galaxy Wearable app doesn't support custom EQ tweaks |
| ✓ Impressive ANC            | ✗ Some users could experience fit issues                   |
| ✓ Respectable battery life  |                                                            |
| ✓ Wireless charging support |                                                            |
| ✓ IPX7 water resistance     |                                                            |

 The [Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Conversation-Resistant/dp/B0B2SFVRC2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are high-end wireless earbuds and the best earbuds for your Galaxy S24\. They offer crisp, balanced sound, respectable battery life, excellent ANC, and IPX7 water resistance. When used with a Samsung phone, you also get features such as 360 Audio for surround sound and Wireless PowerShare, allowing you to charge the earbuds by placing them on the back of your S24.

 Regarding the sound profile, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offers a balanced sound with a slight boost to lower frequencies, which results in a bit of extra bass that doesn’t take over and that sounds great with most genres of music, including hip-hop, electronic, and guitar-driven genres.

 The design here is just right. Unlike the original Buds Pro, the 2nd generation features a slightly rubberized, matte finish that looks and feels much better than the first generation's glossy finish. The case is also matte, rubberized, and super grippy.

 When it comes to negatives, the buds don’t have the best fit and, in most cases, you’ll need to occasionally adjust them, especially while wearing them when walking or doing something else that includes lots of body movement. Also, the Galaxy Wearable app has different EQ presets but doesn’t support custom EQ adjustments.

 Check out the [Galaxy Buds 2](http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight-Graphite/dp/B094242FV1?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or the [Galaxy Buds FE](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Bluetooth-Wing-Tip-Assistant/dp/B0CF7GYNW2?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) if you want something more budget-friendly. Both models offer usable ANC and pretty solid battery life. The most significant difference between the two is that the Galaxy Buds 2 offer a more balanced sound, while the Galaxy Buds FE have lots of extra bass—some would even call them too bassy.

Most Samsung Galaxy S24 owners will be very happy with the Galaxy Buds2 Pro. The Buds2 Pro offer excellent sound, impressive ANC, and a much better design compared to the original Galaxy Buds Pro.

_Caseology_

| Pros              | Cons                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ✓ Striking Design | ✗ Lacks a slidable camera cover |
| ✓ Super grippy    |                                 |
| ✓ Budget-friendly |                                 |

 Caseology’s Parallax line of protective cases presents quality budget options that boast stunning looks, tons of grip, and a decent amount of protection. The [Caseology Parallax Case for the Samsung Galaxy S24](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMZCFJ6W?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) follows the trend, offering a super grippy case with a lovely, unique design.

 First of all, the textured strips covering the sides are super comfortable. Combined with the dual-tone textured design on the back, the result is a case that’ll keep your Galaxy S24 glued to your hands no matter what.

 The case has lifted edges around the screen, offering increased protection against face-down drops. A similar solution is used on the back, with a chunky ridge covering the camera module that provides protection against drops where the back of the phone is the one to hit the pavement.

 Lastly, the case is available in three color flavors, and I have to say that the violet option is one of the best-looking case designs I’ve ever seen. The two-tone coloring on the back, accompanied by two distinct texture designs and that chunky ring encircling the camera module, makes for a unique and smashing look that will make your phone stand out from the crowd while keeping it safe from drops.

 On the flip side, the case doesn’t cover the USB-C charging port and lacks a sliding camera cover, making it not the best choice for Galaxy S24 owners looking for a rugged hard case, or a case with a sliding camera module cover.

 If you’re an out-and-about type and need something more rugged, the [Defender Series Pro case for the Galaxy S24](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001777/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/rugged-galaxy-s24-case-black/77-94620.html) from Otterbox is expensive but super thick and sturdy and features a charging port cover. The [Spigen Optik Armor for the Galaxy S24](https://www.spigen.com/products/galaxy-s24-series-case-optik-armor?variant=41920423264303) is a relatively slim design with a sliding camera cover. Finally, the [Spigen Tough Armor for the Galaxy S24](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Galaxy-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0CM54YKJL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is another rugged design, but this one offers a built-in kickstand.

| Pros                                    | Cons        |

| ✓ Resistant to drops                    |             |
| ✓ Features a quality oleophobic coating |             |

 The [Spigen GlasTR EZ Fit for Galaxy S24](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-designed-Friendly/dp/B0CN8PRJW4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a relatively affordable screen protector for your Samsung Galaxy S24 that comes with an installation kit for hassle-free installation.

 Spigen tempered glass screen protectors are always a great choice since they’re very resistant to drops thanks to their shatterproof film. They're also crystal clear, cover the whole screen including the selfie camera, are easy to install due to the installation kit, and come with a high-end [oleophobic coating](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-online-partnerships-crafting-brand-joint-ventures-on-youtube/) that won’t wear off even after multiple years of usage. While relatively pricey, it’s a terrific choice.

 The [amFilm from TechMatte](https://www.amazon.com/amFilm-Auto-Alignment-OneTouch-Protector-Installation/dp/B0CPJ4KM9C?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a more budget-conscious choice, selling at $10 and coming with an installation kit, like the Spigen one. The downside here is that the amFilm glass doesn’t cover the selfie camera, which doesn’t look as nice as the whole screen coverage offered by the Spigen GlasTR EZ Fit.

| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Braided                           | ✗ Not great as a universal charging cable |
| ✓ Available in multiple lengths     |                                           |
| ✓ Can deliver 25W of charging power |                                           |

 If you’re looking for a USB-C cable you’ll only use for charging your Galaxy S24, the [Anker USB-C to USB-C Cable 60W (3A)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-MacBook-Galaxy-Charger/dp/B088NRLMPV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&th=1&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best choice. It’s light on the budget, comes in a pack of 2, is available in lengths up to 6ft, is braided but not too stiff, and it’ll easily deliver 25W of charging power the Galaxy S24 is limited to.

 On the other hand, it’s not very versatile since it can only deliver up to 3 amps of current. You’ll need a 5A, or a higher-rated cable to charge devices that support 60W or higher USB PD charging profiles, with even some 45W devices needing more than 3A of current.

 If you need something for all your gadgets, check out the [Anker USB-C Charger Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-Charge-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B09LCJPZ1P?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that supports charging up to 100W and can deliver up to 6 amps of current. This one should be good for most of your gadgets, even light laptops, as long as they need 100W of power or less.

 The 100W version is thicker and a bit stiffer, which is expected due to its increased thickness. The good news is that it is not much more expensive and is offered in lengths up to 10ft.

 The official [25W Super Fast Wall Charger from Samsung](http://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Charger-Included-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0CB93HQKP?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best budget-conscious choice for every Samsung Galaxy S24 owner. I've been using this charger with my Galaxy S21 FE for almost two years now, and it's still working as well as it did on the first day.

 The charger’s quite affordable, lightweight, and compact. You can get it without a cable for $20 or with one for $35, but I recommend getting the version without cable.

 The cable version costs $15 more than the cableless version, with the included cable being of lower quality and shorter than Anker’s [60W (3A) USB-C to USB-C Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-MacBook-Galaxy-Charger/dp/B088NRLMPV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&th=1&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The Anker USB-C cable is also sold in a pack of 2 for less than $15, so the choice here is quite clear.

 If you need a more powerful charger to top up your other devices, get the [Anker 736 Nano II charger](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Pixelbook-ThinkPad/dp/B09Q61T39G?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The 736 Nano II can deliver up to 100W of power, supports PPS meaning you’ll get the full 25W of charging power while charging your Galaxy S24, and is quite compact since it’s a [GaN charger](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/oppo-a79-5g-bootloop-problem-how-to-fix-it-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/).

 If you’re looking for a quality wireless charger for your Galaxy S24 and don’t want to break the bank, take a look at the [Anker PowerWave II Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Qi-Certified-Charging/dp/B083BJTY2T/ref=cm%5Fcr%5Farp%5Fd%5Fproduct%5Ftop?ie=UTF8&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The charger features a stand design and can deliver up to 10W of wireless charging power to your phone.

 That’s lower than the maximum of 15W supported by the Galaxy S24\. The thing is, there are only a handful of wireless chargers capable of delivering 15W of wireless power to Samsung Galaxy phones, and they’re all super expensive. The only major downside of the PowerWave II Stand is that it features a barrel power connector, meaning you won’t be able to use a USB-C or a micro USB power adapter if the one the charger ships with breaks.

 If you want a wireless charger capable of delivering 15W of power to your Galaxy S24, your best bet is to buy [the official 15W wireless charger from Samsung](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Universally-Compatible-Included/dp/B09MV4SRP1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It costs $60, but you can find it for less on sale.

 There’s also the [ArcField from Spigen](https://www.spigen.com/products/pf2102-wireless-charger), the only wireless charger from a respectable third-party manufacturer that can deliver 15W of charging power to Samsung Galaxy S phones. However, that one’s even more expensive at $80.

| ✓ Can charge up to three devices at once            |          |
| ✓ Has enough capacity to fully charge the S24 twice |          |

 The [10,000mAh 25W Wireless Battery Pack from Samsung](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Wireless-Warranty-EB-U3300XJEGUS/dp/B084GVM6NC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is hands down the best power bank for your Galaxy S24\. Its best feature is the fact that, unlike many other power banks, it can deliver 25W of charging power. Add to that wireless charging ability—up to 7.5W—and a 10,000mAh capacity, and you’ve got yourself a winner.

 This power bank's real-world capacity should be enough to fully charge your phone twice. You can also use it to charge your earbuds, smartwatch, or any other device that can be topped out via USB-C or the [Qi wireless charging protocol](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mac-users-download-vllo-and-find-alternative-solutions/).

 The power bank is relatively compact but a bit thicker than other 10,000mAh portable chargers. Regarding ports, you’ve got dual USB-C ports, meaning you can charge two devices at once, three as long as one of the devices supports wireless charging, with the only downside being lower charging speed.

 Aside from its increased thickness compared to similar power banks, the Samsung 10,000mAh 25W Battery Pack is also quite expensive and takes a long time (about 12-14 hours\_ to fully charge.

 If you want something lighter on the wallet, check out the [PowerCore 10K](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&th=1&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) from Anker. This one’s slimmer and noticeably more affordable but doesn’t include wireless charging and can only deliver up to 12W of charging power. You can also get the [Anker Nano Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-Compatible-MacBook/dp/B0C9CJKCH3/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) with a capacity of 10,000mAh. Price-wise, this compact portable charger sits between the Samsung Battery Pack and the Anker PowerCore 10K while delivering 25W of power, but lacks the wireless charging feature.

### Do I need Galaxy Buds for my Galaxy S24?

 Absolutely not. While different Galaxy Buds models work great when paired with the Samsung Galaxy S24, you can use any pair of Bluetooth earbuds with your phone. You can also use wired models; just make sure to get a USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter. 

### Will any type of phone case work for my Galaxy S24?

 No, it won’t. For example, while the Galaxy S23 and the Galaxy S24 look almost the same, the new model is slightly taller and narrower, meaning cases made for the Galaxy S23 won’t fit. In other words, only use cases specifically designed for the Galaxy S24\. 

### What wattage do my chargers need to be at for my Galaxy S24?

 In theory, any phone charger with a USB-C power connector will do, no matter its wattage. The only downside is that there's a good chance you won’t get the full 25W charging power supported by the Galaxy S24\. 

 Your best bet is to get the [official 25W charger from Samsung](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Charger-Included-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0CB93HQKP?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s24-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or buy a 25W or a more powerful wall charger with support for Programmable Power Supply (PPS). 

 Thanks to Samsung’s unusual charging profiles, only third-party chargers with [USB PD](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-historys-heaviest-battles-rts-review-of-7-epic-games/) and PPS ---PPS allows for variable voltage and amperage negotiation between the charger and the device its charging--- can deliver 25W to your phone as long as their maximum charging rate is set at 25W or more.

### Does the S24 come with a wall charger?

 No, it doesn’t. You’re only getting a USB-C cable and a SIM ejection pin. 

### Does the S24 have a headphone jack?

 No, it doesn’t. The Samsung Galaxy S24 only features a single USB-C port.
