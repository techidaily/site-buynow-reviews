## 2024'S Most Accurate Activity Trackers Reviewed and Ranked

As someone who tries to be more active in their daily life, a fitness tracker is a great way to be held accountable. Such a wearable lets you track your steps, calories burned, and other vital statistics.

 I’m a massive fan of the Apple Watch Series 9 because it tracks nearly everything I want while looking great. The downside is that it only works with the iPhone, and there are better options for tracking runs in particular.

**TL;DR:** Apple’s smartwatch is the perfect accompaniment to your iPhone because it is very simple to use, looks good, and receives regular updates. Its Activity Rings system regularly motivates you to exercise more.

### Why We Recommend This

 An Apple Watch in some form has been my constant companion for many years, with the latest Apple Watch Series 9 being the best yet. Like many other Apple devices, its greatest strength lies in the fact that it’s straightforward to use.

 Pros

* Accurate tracking
* Gorgeous, easy to read, always-on display
* Endlessly customizable

 Cons

* iPhone-only
* Not the best choice for runners
* Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.

 Pair it up with your iPhone, and you won’t have to do much else if you don’t want to. In the background, it will track how many calories you burn and how many steps you take while motivating you through a series of badges and challenges.

 However, the Apple Watch Series 9’s user interface opens up many more options. It’ll automatically track workouts, but what works better is setting them up manually so you can set intervals on your runs or HIIT workouts.

 The resulting statistics aren’t quite as advanced as a dedicated solution like a Garmin sports watch, but you get far better looks in exchange.

 The Apple Watch Series 9 also makes it simple to take calls from your wrist or reply to messages, so you can stay well-informed without constantly reaching for your phone.

 It also looks good with a large (but not too large) Always-On Retina display that is clear and crisp.

 Plus, you can easily swap out watch bands to have a suitable look for every occasion.

 Extensive sensors such as heart rate tracking, an ECG tool, and crash detection lead to a well-rounded product that gives me peace of mind.

 The Watch 9 also offers blood oxygen monitoring, but[that function was removed for models sold in the U.S. due to a legal issue](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-ditching-blood-oxygen-sensor-8431196) .

* **Who else recommends it?** Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.
* **What do buyers say?** The Apple Watch Series 9 has nearly 1,300 ratings on Amazon, with 84% of reviewers scoring it five stars.

**TL;DR:** Not as attractive as an Apple Watch, the Garmin Forerunner 265 works with both iPhones and Android phones and offers more comprehensive stats for runners. Its body battery tool is impressively accurate, too.

### Why We Recommend This

 As a new runner, the Garmin Forerunner 265 is my idea of heaven. Its stats section is fantastic with laid-out information about pace and speed, highlighting your average and max speed (perfect for making you feel better), with insight into the power involved, cadence, and how much effort it’s likely to have felt for you.  

 Pros

* Extensive stats for runners
* Body battery tool accurately measure energy levels
* Works with all smartphones

 Cons

* Not exactly stylish
* A little bulky

 Thanks to its Body Battery feature, the Garmin Forerunner 265 is similarly helpful during daily activities. The feature monitors your heart rate variability, stress level, sleep quality, and activities to determine your energy level and help you see when your reserves are low and you could use some rest.  

 At the start of each day, it gives you insight into what to expect from yourself and whether now is the right time to push for a personal best. As a chronically ill person, I’ve found it remarkably accurate compared to other tools.

 The Garmin Forerunner 265 offers a device battery life of nearly two weeks, a significant advantage. However, it's important to note that this figure may decrease if you frequently use the GPS. Moreover, it’s a rare smartwatch that caters to Android and iPhone users, offering versatility that's hard to find in other devices.

 While the Garmin Forerunner 265 excels in many areas, it does have a few drawbacks. One of these is its style. It may not be the most aesthetically pleasing device, with practical watch faces and straps that may not suit everyone's style. However, if you're willing to overlook this, it offers many features that make it a worthwhile investment.

* **Who else recommends it?** TechRadar, Tom’s Guide, The Verge, and Trusted Reviews strongly recommend the Garmin Forerunner 265.
* **What do buyers say?** The Garmin Forerunner 265 has 244 ratings from Amazon customers. 85% of those gave it five stars, with another 5% giving it four stars.

**TL;DR:** Highly affordable with all the basics like steps, calories, and sleep monitoring, the Fitbit Inspire 3 is a good option for anyone keeping costs down and who doesn’t need all the added extras.

### Why We Recommend This

 The Fitbit Inspire 3 is a cute little device if you need basic fitness tracking and motivation. It’s pretty sleek, so it fits on your wrist without being particularly noticeable. It also has plenty of colors to choose from. I recommend it regularly as the ideal starter fitness tracker for friends and family.

 Pros

* Lightweight design
* All the essential health-tracking tools
* Easy-to-use mobile app

 Cons

* Screen can be a little small
* Scrolling isn’t great
* No built-in GPS

 The Fitbit Inspire 3 stands out for its user-friendly setup and operation. Even if you're not tech-savvy, the intuitive Fitbit app handles all the complexities. Regular check-ins on the app provide a clear view of your progress towards your step goals, and you can even track your weight if you choose to. The device's compatibility with all smartphones further enhances its ease of use.  

 The Fitbit Inspire 3 keeps everything reasonably simple. While competing devices here may offer advanced metrics and sensors, this focuses on the core goals. That’s fine, although to reap the most benefits, such as comprehensive sleep tracking, you must sign up for Fitbit Premium, a subscription service that expands what the Fitbit Inspire 3 can do.

 It’s not expensive, though, like the device itself. It also has a long battery life of about a week, although some of that is because there’s no built-in GPS. Instead, it depends on your phone to control that side of things.

 If you’re serious about achieving your fitness goals, spend more on the[Fitbit Charge 6](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656291%7Cn256977fe7dcd47ba9699f49a817c7a9e04%7C) or one of the others here, but the Fitbit Inspire 3 is ideal for starting a fitness routine.

* **Who else recommends it?** TechRadar, PCMag, Tom’s Guide, Mashable, and Android Police recommend the Fitbit Inspire 3\.
* **What do buyers think?** The Fitbit Inspire 3 has nearly 12,000 ratings on Amazon, with 70% of those users rating it five stars and an additional 15% rating it four stars.

## How We Test

 I reviewed each fitness tracked based on the following criteria:

* Setup
* Daily use
* Looks
* Device support
* Battery life

 I purchased the Apple Watch Series 9 and Fitbit Inspire 3 for personal use, and the respective companies loaned me the Garmin Forerunner 265, Suunto Race GPS, and Fitbit Charge 6\.

 I used all the devices for at least a month, wearing them on my wrists. I spent time running and working out while wearing them and going about my daily business.

## What to Look For

 Buying a fitness tracker can shake up how active you are daily. It’s essential to think about what you need from it. Check if the fitness tracker is compatible with your phone without limiting features.

 Consider whether you need something with a long battery life or are okay with recharging it each night. Does the fitness tracker match your aesthetic? How comfy is it to wear? All these factors are crucial.

 Other Fitness Trackers We Considered

 The[**Suunto Race GPS**](https://www.amazon.com/SUUNTO-Dual-Band-Touchscreen-Training-Insights/dp/B0CFT1CC3J?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656291%7Cn256977fe7dcd47ba9699f49a817c7a9e04%7C) is an excellent running-focused watch. It’s a little big for small wrists but offers a clear OLED screen and excellent tracking features while you run.

 The[**Fitbit Charge 6**](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656291%7Cn256977fe7dcd47ba9699f49a817c7a9e04%7C) is the company's latest model. Its style is better than the Inspire 3's, albeit for a price. It also has more workout modes and pace alerts to help motivate you.
