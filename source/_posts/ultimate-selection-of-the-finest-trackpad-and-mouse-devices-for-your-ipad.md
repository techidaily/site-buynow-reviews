## Bestselling USB Sticks of 2024: Find the Right One for You

If you're in the market for a new USB flash drive, we recommend focusing on storage capacity, data transfer speeds, and build quality.

 The size of the specific USB flash drive you need depends on your usage requirements. For moderate usage, rely on 128GB or 256GB drives, or 1TB if you have a massive extensive file collection or need extra peace of mind.

 These are our favorites.

 Pros

* Rapidly transfers files to and from other devices
* USB 2.0 and 3.0 backward compatibility

 Cons

* Extra long (about 2 and 1/2 inches long)

**TL;DR** : This SanDisk USB flash drive lives up to its "Extreme" moniker with its 256GB storage capacity and sleek aluminum metal casing. It's easily the sturdiest flash drive we've evaluated.

### Why We Recommend This

 Topping our list of USB flash drives is the SanDisk Extreme PRO. Its 256GB storage space is impressive, and its read and write (data transfer) speeds reach 420Mbps and 380Mbps, respectively.

 To put these speeds in perspective, imagine you had 2GB of data. At these speeds, it can transfer the files to a computer in about 40 seconds and transfer them back in about 42 seconds.

 For comparison, our budget recommendation (read speed of 100Mbps and write speeds of up to 30â€“35Mbps) would take about two minutes and 40 seconds to transfer the files to a computer and nearly nine minutes to transfer them back.

[An Explanation of Read and Write Speeds](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-read-and-write-speeds-2640236)

 In addition to its generous storage space and speed, we thoroughly enjoyed its weighty and sturdy feel. Holding it in hand feels just right, with an even weight distribution throughout. An included keychain hole also helps you attach it to whatever you need (hello, backpack pocket liner!).

 While the SanDisk Extreme PRO is a fantastic device, it's important to note a few design quirks. The retractable plug is convenient feature, but it can sometimes feel stuck and isn't as smooth as we'd like.

 However, a simple adjustment in how you push the plug can quickly resolve this. Push your thumb against the retractable plug's side rather than in the middle.

 This minor inconvenience is unlikely to be a major issue unless you use it constantly.

 Another feature we appreciate about the Extreme PRO is the included RescuePRO Deluxe data recovery suite, which makes it very easy to recover accidentally deleted files. Separately, SanDisk SecureAccess software keeps your information secure using 128-bit encryption.

 Overall, we see the SanDisk Extreme PRO as a true jack of all trades, even compared to other higher-end options on the market.

**Who else recommends it?**  The SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO has received glowing reviews, with Wirecutter recommending it in its USB flash drive guide.

**What do buyers say?**  Most buyers have nothing but good things to say about the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO on Amazon. As of now, it has generated more than 4,400 ratings, with an average of 4.7 stars.

 Pros

* Military-grade aluminum housing
* 200-meter waterproof rating
* Monstrous storage capacity (1TB)
* Great for high-quality audio formats like WAV or FLAC

 Cons

* Quite large (8 inches long)
* Not the most intuitive keychain loop

**TL;DR** : The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth earns our second pick thanks to its adventurous spirit, waterproof rating, and rugged military-style aluminum casing. Oh, and its 1TB storage capacity is impressive too.

### Why We Recommend This

 Resembling a mini flashlight, the Flash Survivor Stealth USB roars with a behemoth 1TB storage capacity. To put that into perspective, it equates to a whopping 209,000 5MB files, enough for a music library that even the most famous international DJ would need, so you're well covered. Other storage options (128GB and 256GB) exist as well.

 When it comes to usability, this Flash Survivor Stealth USB simply rocks. Hold it and enjoy a sturdy aluminum construction with center ridges for a comfortable grip.

 It's also waterproof up to 200 meters, though we were in no hurry to submerge it with valuable data inside and find out if it was true.

 We also appreciate how the Flash Survivor Stealth USB opens. Grab the keychain loop, unscrew it counterclockwise, and pull it out, revealing the slimmer casing underneath and the USB port. To put it back, pop it in and rotate the end clockwise until it becomes tight (like a bottle cap).

 If there's one thing we'd improve about the design, it's the keychain loop. Its integration into the design means the hole is relatively small and difficult to spot. It may also make it hard to clip onto larger key rings. However, keychain loops aren't crucial for USB flash drives, so we'll pardon Corsair for this minor usability issue.

**Who else recommends it?** The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth has seen stellar ratings on sites like TweakTown.

**What do buyers say?** If you look at the Amazon reviews, most Corsair users are pretty ecstatic. Its average 4.5-star rating covers everything from the unit's durability to its 1TB storage capacity.

 Pros

* Solid storage capacity (256GB)
* Moderate reading and writing speeds

 Cons

* Plastic end caps can be tricky to remove with moist hands
* Good, but not excellent, build quality
* Not as many Amazon ratings as our other recs

**TL;DR** : The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is a budget performer, boasting an impressive 256GB storage capacity (great for the price!) and decent, though not exceptional, build quality.

### Why We Recommend This

 The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is one of our favorite budget USB drive options. It's straightforward with few frills, allowing you to easily store your favorite playlist. It boasts a modest read speed of up to 100Mbps and writes speeds of up to 30â€“35 Mbps.

 A transfer rate of up to 100Mbps means that a large 1GB file can be transferred in less than 10 seconds straight from your Kingston to your device. It performs pretty well with no lag time in opening files, unlike other comparably priced options we've tested that missed the mark.

 The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is pretty basic in terms of design. Shaped like a traditional pen drive, it features a plastic end cap and a slight concave ridge for a sturdy grip. Be sure to have dry hands when pulling off the end cap, as it can get stuck.

 We recommend this USB flash drive for anyone seeking a quick and affordable solution. However, if you require the highest storage capacity and fastest read and write speeds possible for a massive music library, stick with the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Solid State Flash Drive.

**Who else recommends it?** Sites like Tomâ€™s Hardware have covered the Kingston DataTraveler, highlighting its dominance over generic Amazon USB flash drives.

**What do buyers say?** Priced at less than $20 and boasting close to 200 ratings with an average of 4.1 stars (as of this writing), Amazon review feedback is generally positive.

## How We Test

 Our recommendations come from three well-known USB drive manufacturers: Kingston, Corsair, and SanDisk. Each excels in different areas.

 To earn passing marks, all of our reviewed USB flash drives must shine in all of the following areas:

* Storage capacity
* Read and write speeds
* Build quality and cost

 Naturally, storage capacity is a matter of preference. An international music DJ may require one terabyte, while a hobbyist may be satisfied with 250GB.

 We also prioritized the highest read and write speeds for our top two picks. Read speed refers to how fast the USB drive can retrieve data from a device (phone, laptop, etc.), whereas write speed refers to how quickly data can be stored.

 If you rarely transfer large files, try to aim for at least 50Mbps read speeds and 20Mbps write speeds. For more regular, large file transfers, we recommend no less than 100Mbps read speeds and 50Mbps write speeds.

 Donâ€™t skimp on build quality either, with a preference toward rugged constructions like the military-grade aluminum Corsair that can withstand plenty of punishment in your bag or purse.

## What to Look For

 When you're searching for the best overall USB flash drive, it all boils down to individual preferences.

 How many files are you looking to save? For example, if you only have a modest photo library (say, 20,000 5MB photos), then a 100GB USB drive will suffice. Anything more than that, and 256GB or even 1TB options could be your best bet.

 If you only care about fast transfers, try to get the fastest read and write speeds available. Aim for anything over 100 Mbps for read speed and above 30Mbps for writing speed. Remember, writing speed will almost always be slower than reading speed.

[The Best USB Flash Drives to Store Music in 2024](https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-flash-drives-for-music-2438381)

 FAQ

* Should you buy an external hard drive or a USB flash drive?  
 Consider an external hard drive if you're looking for a large amount of storage, faster transfer speeds, and don't mind a large form factor and higher cost. A USB flash drive is the way to go for smaller amounts of data in the most portable size available (and even greater plug-and-play convenience).
* Are USB flash drives good for backing up data long term?  
 Flash drives are some of the less reliable storage mediums and are designed (and best used) as temporary envelopes for data transfer. Traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are the best solution for long-term backup, providing the most data stability and capacity for the price. Or, for a faster solution at a higher price tag, consider a solid disk drive (SSD).
* What's the difference between USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB-C flash drives?  
 The USB standard a flash drive is built around will determine its potential performance, including the maximum transfer rate. For instance, the transfer ceiling for USB 3.0 is theoretically ten times higher than 2.0\. Letters following a USB designation (like USB-A, USB-B, or USB-C) indicate the physical type of connection; USB-A is the familiar rectangle most associated with the standard, while USB-C is a reversible flat oval.
