## Expert Picks: Leading Steam Deck Video Games in 2 Cuffs that You Should Play Now
 Valve's[Steam Deck](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-steam-deck-5704880) is a revolutionary gaming PC that lets you take your favorite titles wherever you like. You can throw yourself on the couch and play for hours. It can technically play any PC game if you install Windows. Still, out of the box, it only plays games compatible with Valve's Linux-based operating system or through the Proton translation layer. More than 500 games are verified.

 This list doesn't just pick the best-rated titles on Steam. We also considered how well a game works with a controller, how easy it is to play on a small screen, and how quickly it might drain the battery. Here are the best games for Steam Deck.

## [Best Overall: Hades (PC)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/)

 What We Like

* Gorgeous 2D graphics
* Great story and voice acting
* Excellent controls

 What We Don't Like

* Can be very difficult at times
* Repetitive gameplay isn’t for everyone

[Hades Review](https://www.lifewire.com/hades-review-5184171)

_Hades_ is among the best action games ever made. It combines outstanding controls and a tough yet fair difficulty curve. It's easy to dive in thinking you'll play for half an hour, only to emerge from a sweaty-palmed trance two hours later.

 The game's polish enhances the excellent core gameplay._Hades_ is an achingly beautiful game, especially in motion, and a top-notch soundtrack supports the visuals. The story is bolstered by excellent voice acting.

 It's a difficult game, though difficulty settings are available for less experienced players. It's also a bit repetitive, as the game unfolds over multiple attempts to escape Hades.

 The developer, Supergiant, designed_Hades_ for every gaming device under the sun, so it controls well on any console, including the Steam Deck. It's not a graphically demanding game, either, so it won't chew up your battery.

Nintendo

 What We Like

* Gorgeous old-school graphics
* Surprisingly diverse gameplay
* Easy to pick up and play

 What We Don't Like

* Story is good, but simple
* Turn-based combat can be divisive

 You weren’t expecting this, were you? You expected_The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt_ or_God of War_ . Those are great games, but their demanding graphics aren’t the best fit for the Deck._Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling_ is a different role-playing game (RPG). It’s approachable, great for all ages, and has simple (though attractive) graphics that won’t tax the Deck’s battery life.

 A love letter to Nintendo’s_Paper Mario_ franchise,_Bug Fables_ mashes traditional turn-based RPG combat with various timing-based attacks. This keeps the deliberate pace of a turn-based RPG but adds more active, engaging combat than most games in this genre.

 As its graphical style hints,_Bug Fables_ is a family-friendly game that doesn’t delve into mature concepts. Still, it has a fun story, comical characters, charming music, and clever writing. This game has something for everyone.

 What We Like

* Excellent story and pacing
* Top-notch controls
* Lots of accessibility options

 What We Don't Like

* A bit short
* Very difficult on default settings

 Platforming is the most competitive genre on the Steam Deck at launch. There are dozens of games, but_Celeste_ rises to the top of this hotly contested slot. It's an outrageously fun, tight, and smooth platformer. The controls are excellent, and the gameplay is so slick it feels wired to your brain. The game has a[Linux](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) native version, too.

_Celeste_ is a challenging game, but the game’s rapid pace makes each death feel less punishing. Don’t want the grind? You can dig into the game’s accessibility options and tune it to your preference.

 The graphics may seem basic, but the story is deep, personal, and more impactful than most games, several times its length. Indeed, length is the game’s only downside. You’ll be craving more when it’s over.

## [Best Strategy Game: Sid Meier's Civilization VI](https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid%5FMeiers%5FCivilization%5FVI/)

Steam

 What We Like

* Extremely deep gameplay
* Many ways to play
* Turn-based pace is great for mobile

 What We Don't Like

* Can be a time sink
* Small text may be hard to read

 The_Civilization_ franchise is a decades-old mainstay of[PC gaming](https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-pc-gaming-831754) , so it’s fitting that the latest title,_Civilization VI_ , is great on the Steam Deck. This complex turn-based strategy game lets you create an alternative history of the world with dozens of civilizations and an endless array of randomly generated maps.

_Civilization_ _VI_ has received numerous updates, and two big expansion packs, since its release in 2016\. It’s packed with features, improvements, and balance changes that refine the experience. New players can turn down the difficulty and have fun, but veterans can spend hours fretting over the precise placement of cities and improvements.

 In partnership with Aspyr, Firaxis Games has made_Civilization VI_ a Linux native game, and the turn-based pace makes it easy to play on the go. You can put the game down anytime and fire it back up at a moment’s notice.

## [Best First-Person Shooter: SUPERHOT](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322500/SUPERHOT/)

Nintendo

 What We Like

* Unique bullet time gameplay
* Excellent controls
* Great for short sessions

 What We Don't Like

* Very short campaign
* No multiplayer

_SUPERHOT_ is a game that never feels dated. It upsets expectations for a first-person shooter with a unique hook: Your foes move when you move. The result is a strange, exhilarating first-person dance that recalls the bullet-time effects made famous by_The Matrix_ .

 This game is another Linux native title, which means it will play with zero issues on Steam Deck. The stylized 3D graphics aren’t demanding, either, so the title is fairly light on battery use and feels smooth.

 Unfortunately,_SUPERHOT’s_ campaign is short, lasting just three hours for most players. Extra modes add variety and challenge for those who find the gameplay addictive. Players who want more can check out the sequel,_SUPERHOT: Mind Control Delete_ , a Linux native title.

 What We Like

* Relaxing, yet offers plenty of depth
* Numerous ways to play
* Charming graphics and excellent music

 What We Don't Like

* Lack of challenge will turn off some
* Controls are merely decent

 Want a game that lets you sit back, relax, and play at your own pace?_Stardew Valley_ remains undefeated. This famous indie game puts you in charge of your farm and then sets you off to harvest crops, befriend neighbors, and explore mines at your own pace.

 The game's relaxing pace doesn't mean it lacks depth._Stardew Valley_ takes at least 50 hours to reach the "ending," but this is just one step in their journey for many. Dedicated players can spend over a hundred hours collecting every item and befriending every non-player character (NPC).

_Stardew Valley's_ controls can take some getting used to, especially in gamepad mode (which you'll likely use on the Steam Deck). Still, its charming graphics and excellent music help set it apart from other chill games. It's Linux native, too, ensuring smooth and bug-free gameplay.

Nintendo

 What We Like

* Inventive gameplay
* Simple yet alluring graphics
* Very easy on the hardware

 What We Don't Like

* Can leave you stumped for hours
* Light on story

_Baba Is You_ is a baffling puzzle game. It's bafflingly difficult, bafflingly brilliant, and bafflingly unique. The game's core hook is simple sentences formed by pushing word blocks around the screen. They change the rules of the level, making it possible to accomplish what initially seems impossible. This hook starts cleverly, letting you warp through walls or flip characters, and ends with the player creating mini-games and bending the laws of physics.

 Indeed, the game's baffling concept is its only real downside. The puzzles are complex, and it's hard to resist the temptation to look up the solutions. The game isn't challenging on the Steam Deck, though. It's a Linux-native game, and the simple 2D graphics will conserve battery life.

Steam

 What We Like

* Outrageously creepy
* Excellent art style and music
* Simple, effective controls

 What We Don't Like

* Story is bare-bones
* Might be too much for some

_Inside_ doesn't look that frightening at a glance. The game's 2D platforming action and dark graphics appear foreboding but fall short of terror. Then you play the game.

 What makes_Inside_ a horror masterpiece is its use of suspense to drive the game forward. It's not a challenging game, but the sense of dread can make it feel more tasking than it is. You spend most of the game defenseless with no option but to escape.

_Inside_ isn't demanding on the Steam Deck's hardware, so it will run smoothly and help squeeze decent life from the battery. The game isn't fast-paced, but it controls well and is easy to learn. It's also a short game, lasting four hours at most, and the story leaves much to your imagination. The game's predecessor,_Limbo_ , offers a similar experience if you want more.

Funselektor Labs

 What We Like

* Top-notch visuals
* Intuitive and fast-paced racing
* Easy to pick up, yet challenging

 What We Don't Like

* Not much variety
* Arcade style isn't for everyone

 Racing fans aren’t spoiled for choice, as most popular racing games aren’t Steam Deck verified at launch._Art of Rally_ fills this gap with a fun, approachable, challenging arcade-style rally experience.

 First things first: this game looks great. It’s not realistic, obviously, but the punchy visuals stand out. They make the game easy to play on a small screen._Art of Rally_ is a Linux native title, too, so it should be a smooth and bug-free experience.

 The arcade-style structure is easy for new players to dig into, but the game can prove challenging as the levels progress. Rally racing requires split-second decisions, and this game is no different. Art of Rally is hampered only by focusing on its subject like other rally games. There are no big races, head-to-head battles, or a destruction derby. It’s all rally, all the time.

505 Games

 What We Like

* Unique heist gameplay
* Lots of missions and modes
* Easy on the hardware

 What We Don't Like

* No single-player mode
* No competitive mode

_Payday 2_ is a four-player co-op heist game that is Steam Deck verified and has a Linux native client.

 First released in 2013,_Payday 2_ has matured from a tight co-op game into a sprawling entity with many maps and modes. At its core, however, it remains unique. As a heist game, you need careful coordination and a hint of stealth to get away with the goods. The game is so focused on heists that it may turn off some players. There’s no single-player campaign and no competitive mode.

_Payday 2_ is not a graphically demanding game, which is good news for the Steam Deck. Players who cap the framerate may see decent battery life. Heists are short, too, making the game ideal for quick sessions.

## What to Look for in a Steam Deck Game

### System Requirements

 The Steam Deck is a portable gaming PC, and all PC games have minimum and recommended system requirements. If the Steam Deck doesn't meet these requirements, your play experience will be terrible (if the game runs at all). Right now, the best way to tell if a game is good on Steam Deck is Valve's Deck Verified system. Valve is reviewing its entire Steam catalog for Steam Deck compatibility. Games that run great on the handheld have a Verified label. Playing games labeled Playable require some settings tweaks, while Unsupported games won't work. Titles labeled "Unknown" are ones Valve hasn't tested yet.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Length

 While a video game's length (or lack of length) doesn't indicate its quality, how much time you're willing to spend with it is essential. Do you love to get lost in a game world for dozens of hours? Or are you in the mood for a bite-sized experience you can finish in a single evening? Maybe you're a completionist who likes to find every collectible and complete every side quest before moving on to the next adventure. No matter what type of gamer you are, it helps to know what kind of time commitment a game requires before buying it.

### Install Size

 The Steam Deck portable gaming console has limited hard drive space; its three models have either 64GB, 256GB, or 512GB solid-state drives. Games are getting larger and larger all the time. Bungie's MMO_Destiny 2_ requires over 100GB, for example. So consider install sizes and limited storage when buying a new Steam title. Also, consider expanding the Steam Deck's storage by adding a high-speed microSD card. That way, you'll have no problems downloading all the games you want to play.

[Is the Steam Deck Worth It? 4 Reasons Why You Should Get This PC Gaming Handheld](https://www.lifewire.com/is-steam-deck-worth-it-8423217)

 FAQ

* What are the Steam Deck’s specs?  
 The Steam Deck has an AMD APU with[four processor cores](https://www.lifewire.com/multiple-core-processors-832453) , eight GPU compute units, and 16GB of[DDR5 RAM](https://www.lifewire.com/types-of-ram-4150713) . Storage starts at 64GB in the basic model and runs up to 512GB in the top-tier Deck. The 7-inch touchscreen has a resolution of 1280x800 pixels and a 60Hz refresh rate. This device also has[Wi-Fi 6](https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345) , Bluetooth 5, and a[USB-C port](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490) that provides wired connectivity.
* What’s the difference between the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch?  
 The Nintendo Switch is the smaller of the two and has detachable controllers that you can use to play games while connected to a television through the dock. Its hardware is significantly less capable than the Steam Deck, so games generally run at lower framerates and a lower resolution. Each device supports a different library of games. The Switch only runs titles sold for the Switch, while Valve's Steam Deck can, in theory, run any Windows or Linux compatible game. However, the Steam Deck doesn't come with Windows installed by default.
* Which Steam Deck should I get?  
 The Steam Deck comes in three models that differ in storage and price. The mid-priced model with a 256GB NVMe drive is our recommendation. That might not sound like a lot of storage, but keep in mind the Steam Deck does have expandable storage, and most games that work well on it have an install size below 10 gigabytes.
