## Maximize Gaming Space: Upgrade Your Xbox Series with Seagate’s Extra Memory Booster

Good news—memory cards are back in gaming vogue. If you missed the days of the N64 and PlayStation memory cards, there's still a way to enjoy the novelty with the Xbox Series consoles.

 Did you know that the [Xbox Series X](https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/xbox-series-x%7Cs/consoles/products/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console/229056.html) and S consoles have an expansion slot on the back of them? This is one of the easier ways to expand your console's memory so you can download more games. It's very similar to the memory cards of the PS1 and PS2 days, even down to its relative size.

 And just like those old memory cards, there are several expansion cards available on the market, but when it comes to data, you don't want to gamble on cheaper options. So, to be safe, it's best to go with the [Seagate Storage Expansion Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08K3S6WJM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002176&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fxbox-expansion-card-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate). This expansion card is officially approved by Microsoft and connects seamlessly to the [Xbox Velocity Architecture](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/07/14/a-closer-look-at-xbox-velocity-architecture/), which includes a custom NVME SSD built to work with the Xbox Series consoles, and other features such as DirectStorage API. In short, it's the company's fancy way of saying the expansion card can take full advantage of the console's hardware and software. 

 Seagate's card, which comes in [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08K3S6WJM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002176&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fxbox-expansion-card-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) and [2TB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BJYXMDW?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002176&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fxbox-expansion-card-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) options, is the only official option when it comes to expansion cards. The expansion cards are more expensive than most of the unofficial options on the market, but you can be sure that the cards aren't faulty and break, taking all of your precious data with you.

 But now you can save on one of our [favorite Xbox Series accessories](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-optimizing-your-project-b-roll-utilization-tips-for-2024/) on Amazon. Currently, the 1TB Expansion Card is available for $125.99, $34 off the full $159.99 price. The 2TB option has the deeper discount—at $249.99, that's $110 off the $349.99 MSRP. That's a hefty price cut, and given the expansion cards work in ways that [external SSDs](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-optimize-logitech-footage-background-free-method/) can't replicate, it's worth the price.
