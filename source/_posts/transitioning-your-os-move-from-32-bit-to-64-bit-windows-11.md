 This comparison focuses on the Switch OLED and Lite, but what about the original Switch?

* It's still available and often cheaper than the Switch OLED but pricier than the Switch Lite.
* It's better than the Switch Lite if you plan on using it connected to your TV, but if you want the best-looking portable games console, you need the Switch OLED.

 The Nintendo Switch OLED is the newest model and came out in late 2021.

 You can see the obvious difference in size between the OLED and Lite models.

## How Are They Different?

 The Nintendo Switch OLED has a far better screen than the Switch Lite. Its 7-inch display features OLED technology, which means a sharper and more vibrant image.

 Having pixels that light up individually to each other means you get brighter colors and deeper blacks, so it looks far better in portable mode. The Nintendo Switch isn’t generally a visual powerhouse, but its game catalog is often vibrant, cute, and gorgeous on the right screen.

 Playing games on the Switch OLED felt a bit more exciting. It might only be a visual improvement, but games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Wonder deserve to be presented in the best possible light.

 After upgrading from the Switch Lite to the Switch OLED, I replayed games to see how prettier they looked.

 Due to the lack of a dock, you’re also dependent on connecting to the internet via Wi-Fi only when using a Switch Lite, compared to the Switch OLED, which has an Ethernet port. Similarly, there’s no way to connect the Switch Lite via HDMI, so you won’t be able to stream games from it.

 The Switch OLED also has 64GB of internal storage compared to 32 GB on the Switch Lite, but in both cases, you can upgrade the storage with microSD cards.

## Flexibility: Advantage OLED

 The most significant difference between the Nintendo Switch OLED and the Switch Lite is its flexibility.

 The Switch Lite is solely a portable gaming device. It works brilliantly for that, as I found when playing through many games while bedridden while recovering from surgery.

 It’s very light to hold and isn’t too bulky, even for smaller hands. That’s why it’s particularly appealing to children, further helped by its plasticky shell, which feels like it can handle a few accidental drops.

 The Nintendo Switch OLED is bulkier but can connect to your TV via the dock. Doing so lets you play multiplayer games once you unhook the Joy-Con controllers and gives you a bigger-screen experience compared to the Switch Lite.

 Only one person at a time can play the Switch Lite, and you can’t detach the controllers, which means certain games won’t function with the Switch Lite—at least not unless you use separate Joy-Con controllers.

## Switch Lite: Limited Games

 The Switch Lite is helpful if you want a games console to use while traveling or to hand to your kids before a long journey.

 However, if you plan to play games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on your TV for the whole family to join in, you’ll need the Switch or Switch OLED.

 I tried playing multiplayer games on the Switch Lite by connecting a spare pair of Joy-Con controllers, but it’s a frustratingly small screen to do so.

## Final Thoughts: Each Model Has Its Advantages

 There's no bad Nintendo Switch console. Each has its own merits, depending on your situation.

* If you want to play it portably and weight and size are important, go for the Nintendo Switch Lite.
* If you want the best of both worlds and plan on sometimes playing portably but also playing on the TV, the Nintendo Switch OLED is the ultimate choice.

 The Switch Lite was a worthy companion while recovering from surgery and whenever I traveled. It's the cheapest way to play Switch games, but you won't easily play other games with someone sitting next to you.

 The Nintendo Switch will suffice if you plan on exclusively connecting it to your TV so you can play with friends and family easily or enjoy a bigger-screen experience.

 There's no need to pay for a superior screen if you plan to use your TV the whole time.

 The Switch OLED's screen is superior to an LCD one and is comfortable enough to complete large games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim without connecting it to the TV.

 However, it's helpful to connect it to the TV to play games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the family or when you want to take in more of a game.
