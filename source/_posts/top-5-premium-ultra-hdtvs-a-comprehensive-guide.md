##  What to Look for With an 8K TV in 2024

 8K TVs have come a long way in just a few years. Not only has the number of 8K televisions on the market grown, but their pricing has also come down significantly in some cases. They no longer seem entirely superfluous and are becoming a reasonable investment.

 An essential feature to look for in an 8K TV is its [upscaling capability](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/your-roadmap-to-mastery-the-ultimate-guide-to-google-podcasting/). Upscaling is the process used by the television to increase the resolution of lower-resolution content. As you'll mostly watch 4K, Full-HD, and HD content on your TV, upscaling quality will play a significant role in making such content look good on screen.

 The scarcity of native 8K content is often cited as an argument against 8K TVs. But with upscaling, you'll still be able to enjoy the full resolution of your 8K TV. If you are looking for the best TV technology, 8K TVs are your best bet as they include the best of what TV manufacturers have to offer.

 You'll also want the 8K TV to offer a fantastic visual experience. There are two display technologies currently available in 8K TVs—[LED](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-unraveling-untethered-art-top-public-domain-gems-for-2024/) and [OLED](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/). Both have their positives and negatives. However, 8K OLED TVs are currently rare and exorbitantly expensive, so unless you have a fair bit of cash, you'll be looking at an LED 8K TV.

[Bang & Olufsen](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU208705/https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/us/televisions/beovision-harmony) and [LG](https://www.amazon.com/LG-77-Inch-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED77Z2PUA/dp/B09RMXJ98C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208705&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F754591%2Fbest-8k-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are the only manufacturers offering 8K OLED TVs in the US, and even Bang & Olufsen's 8K TV is based on LG tech. LED 8K TVs, on the other hand, are far more common and come from a variety of TV makers. LED TVs overall have less risk of [burn-in](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/in-2024-virtual-arena-transcript/) and other issues OLED has, as well.

Samsung

| Pros                                             | Cons                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Top-notch picture quality                        | Expensive               |
| Impressive upscaling of lower-resolution content | No Dolby Vision support |
| One-Connect box helps with a clean setup         |                         |

 If you have the budget and want the bleeding edge of television technology, it’s hard to go wrong with Samsung’s [QN900C 8K TV](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-Inch-Infinity-Tracking-QN65QN900C/dp/B0BTMKGBGJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208705&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F754591%2Fbest-8k-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). A successor to our previous pick for this category, the QN900C shines in almost every aspect of television viewing. 

 Thanks to the [quantum dot technology](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-poco-x6-pin-codepattern-lockpassword-by-drfone-android/), [Mini-LED backlighting](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), and impressive implementation of [full-array local dimming](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/), the Samsung 8K TV produces breathtaking visuals with deep blacks and high brightness. The high peak brightness of the TV helps it bring out even the smallest highlights in HDR content. Unfortunately, as the TV doesn’t support [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/), you will only get to enjoy content in [HDR10](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/), [HDR10+](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-pathway-to-prosperity-a-graphic-designers-journey/), and HLG formats. That said, any Dolby Vision content will fall back to [regular HDR](https://win-able.techidaily.com/defeating-pc-launch-obstacles-in-days-gone-a-step-by-step-troubleshooting-guide/), so it’s not a complete miss.

 It also has a wide [color gamut](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/) and can cover most of the DCI-P3 color space. Plus, the Samsung QN900C has decent viewing angles despite using a VA-style LCD panel, as the company employs its “Ultra Viewing Angle” layer. 

 As there is little native 8K content, you will be happy to know that the QN900C excels in the upscaling department. So, the lower-resolution content is appropriately upscaled, and the resulting image is sharp, clear, and full of detail. 

 Tizen OS powers the smart TV functions, and it’s easy to use with a solid selection of apps, including popular streaming services. 

 The TV also looks great, has a good build quality, and its center stand takes up little space. Samsung ships the QN900C with a One Connect box, which has all the I/O ports, so you can have a cleaner setup by hiding the One Connect box in a cabinet.

Samsung

| Pros                                 | Cons                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Native 144Hz refresh rate            | No Dolby Vision                    |
| Impressive visual performance        | Can’t display a 1440p 144Hz signal |

| Low input lag and fast response time |                                    |
| Four HDMI 2.1 ports                  |                                    |

 Besides being our best overall pick, the [Samsung QN900C](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-Inch-Infinity-Tracking-QN65QN900C/dp/B0BTMKGBGJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208705&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F754591%2Fbest-8k-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best 8K TV for gaming. It delivers a fantastic visual experience and has all the necessary components for a top-notch gaming TV. For example, it has a native 144Hz panel for high refresh rate gaming and supports VRR technologies from [AMD](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-from-chats-to-files-the-methodical-approach-to-downloading-fb-video-for-2024/), [HDMI Forum](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-phone-with-ease-the-3-best-lock-screen-removal-tools-by-drfone-android/), and [NVIDIA](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/). You also get low input lag for a responsive gaming experience and fast response time for superior motion handling. 

 There are four HDMI 2.1 ports on the One Connect box, including one that doubles as an [eARC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/) port. So you will have no trouble connecting one or more of your consoles or gaming PCs. HDMI 2.1 also enables the TV to support a 4K 120Hz or 8K 60Hz signal.

 Another highlight is that you can enjoy HDR gaming as the TV supports HDR10 and HDR10+. The TV also comes with Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which offers native access to popular cloud gaming services, such as [Amazon Luna](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-av1-versus-vp9-the-ultimate-codec-showdown/), [NVIDIA GeForce Now](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/smileshop-memelore-hub/), and [Xbox Cloud Gaming](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-cinematic-illumination-a-filmmakers-path-to-stunning-colors/), as well as several nifty gaming-related enhancements. Plus, Samsung’s excellent upscaling technology will ensure your games look great on the TV’s 8K screen. 

 Unfortunately, you don’t get Dolby Vision support on the QN900C. The TV also [can’t display a 1440p signal at 144Hz](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/qn900c-8k-qled#test%5F206) and has trouble with the 4K 144Hz signal coming from NVIDIA graphics cards. The rest of the resolutions and frame rates work as intended. 

 You can buy the Samsung QN900C in [65-inch](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-Inch-Infinity-Tracking-QN65QN900C/dp/B0BTMKGBGJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208705&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F754591%2Fbest-8k-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [75-inch](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-Inch-Infinity-Tracking-QN65QN900C/dp/B0BTMQCPRW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208705&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F754591%2Fbest-8k-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [85-inch](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-Inch-Infinity-Tracking-QN65QN900C/dp/B0BTMLMT8T/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208705&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F754591%2Fbest-8k-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) sizes.

| Pros                                           | Cons            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| OLED panel delivers impressive picture quality | Very expensive  |
| Dolby Vision IQ support                        | No HDR10+       |
| Premium design                                 | Risk of burn-in |

 Your 8K OLED options are pretty much limited to LG. If you want the perfect blacks with a near-infinite contrast ratio, your best bet is the [LG Z2](https://www.amazon.com/LG-77-Inch-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED77Z2PUA/dp/B09RMXJ98C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208705&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F754591%2Fbest-8k-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It's the top-of-the-line television in the company's lineup and comes with all the bells and whistles you can expect. But obviously, its OLED panel is the main highlight, enabling the television to produce jaw-dropping visuals and offer excellent viewing angles.

 Given the lack of 8K content, you'll also be happy to know that the Z2's Alpha 9 Gen 5 8K processor upscales lower-resolution content well. All your DVDs and Blu-rays will look good on this gorgeous screen.

 Plus, the TV has a minimalist and clean design. And thanks to a uniform rear panel, it hangs neatly on a wall. But if you prefer a table-mount look, feet are included in the box.

 In other features, webOS handles the software duties, like other LG TVs, and it's relatively easy to use and offers access to all popular apps, including streaming services.

 LG has also kept the gamers in mind while building the Z2, and it comes with a native 120Hz refresh rate to enable high refresh rate gaming, [ALLM](https://win11.techidaily.com/turn-the-tide-solving-chrome-file-upload-issues-on-windows-pcs/) for automatic enabling of the game mode, and VRR support.

 Finally, the HDR performance of the Z2 is excellent, and there is support for [Dolby Vision IQ](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-10-hashtag-trackers-on-facebook-twitter-and-instagram-networks/) and HDR10 formats.

 You can buy the Z2 in [77-inch](https://www.amazon.com/LG-77-Inch-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED77Z2PUA/dp/B09RMXJ98C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208705&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F754591%2Fbest-8k-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [88-inch](https://www.amazon.com/LG-77-Inch-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED77Z2PUA/dp/B09RMHY7ZT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208705&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F754591%2Fbest-8k-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) sizes. However, the 77-inch model is significantly more affordable than the 88-inch model, the latter of which being at an eye-watering $25,000.
