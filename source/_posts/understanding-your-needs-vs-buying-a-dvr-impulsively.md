 It has a built-in USB-C cable, a second USB-C port, and a USB-A port. These options ensure compatibility with basically anything that charges over USB, including headphones, laptops, phones, and watches.

 To highlight its efficiency, the charger can power up an iPhone 15 Pro from empty to approximately 60 percent in just 30 minutes. Plus, the device itself only needs a couple of hours to top up.

 Finally, it's safe for air travel, making it the perfect companion for all your summer plans.

 To save space, you need a flashlight like this one. Along with being under seven inches long, it doesn't need batteries.

 Instead, this 1000-lumen, waterproof flashlight charges its 1,200 mAh battery in the sun or via a USB cable. It even doubles as a small power bank, allowing you to transfer its sun-provided power to other USB devices.

 If you struggle to stay hydrated in the summer, you might just need “The World’s Smartest Water Bottle.”

 HidrateSpark’s leak-proof and Bluetooth-enabled container keeps your drink cold all day. Its companion app ensures you never leave the bottle behind and reminds you when to use it by tracking your water intake.
