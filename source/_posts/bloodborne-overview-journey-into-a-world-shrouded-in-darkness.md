 What We Like

* Smaller design makes it easy to slide under desk
* Massage mounds to promote feet circulation
* Inclines to promote leg stretches
* Cushy, but firm design

 What We Don't Like

* Smaller design makes it hard to stay in mat boundaries
* Slippery on all surfaces

 While the bumps and curves of the Ergohead Standing Desk Mat make it easy to alter positions and relieve back pain, it’s a little slippery on the bottom.

 _We purchased Ergohead Standing Desk Mat so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

 Standing desks are increasingly popular in office and at home, but they often come at the cost of back and leg pain. That’s why standing desk mats are often a necessary accessory to pair with your standing desk. We tested the Ergohead Standing Desk over the course of a week, using it for multiple hours each day. We found it to be comfortable for extended periods of time, though somewhat prone to sliding due to its slippery bottom.

## **Design: A little clunky**

 At 29 inches by 26.5 inches by 3.3 inches (LWH), the Ergomat is a fairly small mat relative to other standing desk mats. We noticed when we began testing it that it’s not as wide as some of its competitors. This isn’t really a big deal, as we could alter our posture to accommodate the mat without any bad physical side effects.

 The massage mounds, the ankle mounts, and the rear inclines are all huge selling points for long-term comfort.

 The mat has two separate inclines in the back and a set of massage mounds at the front of the mat. On each side, there is a curved edge where you can stand and stretch your inner thigh muscles as you work at your desk while promoting arch support. All of these allow the person standing to position themselves in ten different ways. Overall, the design of this mat, made from polyurethane foam, is really sturdy. Our only minor issue is that we wish the standing space was wider.

## **Comfort: Great small perks, but dangerously slippery**

 One of the aspects of the Ergohead Standing Mat we really liked was the massage mounds in the front. While this part of the mat was firm, it was also really cushy, allowing the ball arches of our feet to sink into the mat. Our feet didn’t feel achy over the three hours a day we tested it, perhaps because we were regularly pressing our feet into these massage mounds. They’re a really valuable feature on this mat.

 While this part of the mat was firm, it was also really cushy and allowed the balls arches of our feet to sink into the mat.

 Off to the side of each mat, there are two curved mounds on which you can stand to stretch leg muscles as well. They’re great for rolling your ankles to give them some relief. The inclines located at the back of the mat are also really beneficial. If you get stuck at your desk for the day, this is a great way to circulate the blood in your lower leg muscles and stretch them. We were able to use both inclines to really feel the pull in those muscles. It felt like we were attending a mini yoga session designed solely for our legs.

 The Ergohead Standing Desk Mat is suitable for all surfaces. It’s designed to slide under desks in case a project requires sitting for a while, but in doing so, the mat becomes slippery. We tested it under both tile floors and carpeted floors, and were stunned at how easily the mat slides. Don’t get us wrong, this is a huge perk for carpeted floors in an office. However, for tiled floors, we were concerned that it would become a safety hazard. If you walked over to the mat too quickly, you could lose our footing and fall. If you decide to use this mat, we recommend it for carpeted surfaces only.

## **Price: Perfect for the basics**

 At around $80 on Amazon, the Ergohead mat is one of the more expensive mats on the market. That said, this mat also comes with some huge perks, like the massage mounds in the front and the calf stretching inclines in the back. It may seem like a lot, but when you’re standing on your feet all day, $80 is a small price to pay.

## **Ergohead Standing Desk Mat vs. CubeFit TerraMat**

 We tested the Ergohead mat in comparison with the CubeFit TerraMat to see which one was better bang for your buck. Cost-wise, the TerraMat is a little more expensive, retailing at around $100\. In terms of features, each of them comes with an array of balance beams, massage mounds, and power wedges to ensure you can stretch and keep your legs and back from aching.

 However, the TerraMat definitely shows more dirt as you use it. That can make it look unsightly, if only because the makers of TerraMat encourage you to take off your shoes before you use it. The Ergohead, on the other hand, masks dirt a little better thanks to a rougher surface area.

 However, these mats are so similar that realistically, you can’t go wrong with either. If you prefer a dirt-free aesthetic (and want to wear shoes), we recommend the Ergohead. If dirt doesn’t bother you, then the TerraMat would suit your needs just fine. Either would work if you’re willing to take your shoes off.

 Final Verdict

**Good, but not great.**

 Overall, we really liked some aspects of the Ergohead Standing Desk Mat. The massage mounds, the ankle mounts, and the rear inclines are all huge selling points for long-term comfort. However, the slipperiness of this mat makes us second guess safety on surfaces that aren’t carpeted. We would definitely use this mat, however, it will need to be solely on carpeted surfaces.
