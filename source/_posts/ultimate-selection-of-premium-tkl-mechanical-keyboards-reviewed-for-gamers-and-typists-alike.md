##  What to Look For in a TKL Mechanical Keyboard in 2024

 If you’re working with a small desk or want to free up space for sweeping mouse movements, it’s hard to go wrong with a TKL mechanical keyboard. These offer much of the same functionality as a full-size keyboard, though they lack a keypad---which frees up significant space and makes TKL keyboards so much smaller. They’re not as tiny as 60% keyboards, however, and with 87 keys they’re the perfect combination of form and function.

 Shopping for a TKL keyboard is a bit complicated, as there are tons of factors to consider. The first is determining the [types of switches](https://techidaily.com/sign-a-pdf-v10-document-with-digital-signature-software-by-ldigisigner-sign-a-pdf-sign-a-pdf/) you’d like. This is no different from shopping for a full-size mechanical keyboard, as the same switches work across both formats. Red switches are good for gaming, brown switches are good for typing, and blue switches are great for folks who love audible feedback on every keystroke.

 You’ll also want to look at both wired and wireless connections. Wireless models are often more expensive than their wired siblings. Some cheap wireless keyboards might suffer input lag, but reliable products from big names like Logitech and SteelSeries are typically fine for all but pro gamers.

 There are a few other factors to consider, such as [RGB lighting](https://win11.techidaily.com/building-win11-sfx-archives-with-ease/), customization options, durability, and programmable buttons, but these should only be considered after deciding on your switches and connection format. If you need help sifting through all the products available, here’s a look at the five best TKL mechanical keyboards you can buy now.

##  Best TKL Keyboard Overall: [SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Apex-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B07TBGQ6P7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904551&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL on a gaming desk with red and pink lights.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/steelseries-pro-2.jpg) 

_SteelSeries_

| Pros                          | Cons      |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| Adjustable actuation distance | Expensive |
| Includes a wrist rest         |           |
| Impressive build quality      |           |
| Built-in OLED display         |           |

 The big selling point of the [SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Mechanical Keyboard](http://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Apex-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B07TBGQ6P7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904551&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is its OmniPoint adjustable switches. These allow you to customize the actuation distance anywhere from 0.4mm to 3.6mm---giving you more flexibility than most other boards on the market.

 Aside from these innovative switches, the Apex Pro TKL boasts aluminum construction for durability, RGB lighting with access to over 16 million colors, and a magnetic wrist rest for improved ergonomics. Of course, you’ll pay for all these premium features, with the keyboard inching close to $200 when not on sale.

 One of the quirkier features of the Apex Pro is its built-in OLED screen. Located in the top right corner, this tiny screen can be used to adjust settings on the fly or check info from Discord, Spotify, or other apps. It’s a great feature for streamers or folks who listen to music while gaming, although its usefulness may vary from person to person. Still, it’s a great inclusion you won’t find on many of its rivals.

 Aside from its hefty price, there’s not much to complain about with the Apex Pro TKL. Reliable, durable, and highly customizable, SteelSeries knocked it out of the park with this nearly perfect keyboard.

_HyperX_

| Pros                             | Cons                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Affordable price                 | Kickstands don't offer much incline |
| Multiple switch types            |                                     |
| Versatile customization software |                                     |

 Clocking in at less than $100, the [HyperX Alloy Origins Core](https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Alloy-Origins-Core-Customization/dp/B084GYSFDT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904551&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a well-rounded keyboard. With all the available switch types ([HyperX Red](https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Alloy-Origins-Core-Customization/dp/B07YMHGP86?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904551&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [HyperX Aqua](https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Alloy-Origins-Core-Customization/dp/B084GYSFDT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904551&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [HyperX Blue](https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Alloy-Origins-Core-Customization/dp/B08YP9VMSN?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904551&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)), you’ll benefit from 100% anti-ghosting and N-key rollover that ensures all your keystrokes are registered.

 Toss in tons of customization options using the [NGENUITY Software](https://hyperx.com/?loc=US&lang=EN) and a detachable USB Type-C for portability, and it’s easy to see the appeal of this budget-minded board. Some users will find its kickstand to be a bit of a letdown—it offers three tilt angles, but it only ranges from 3 degrees to 11 degrees—but that’s a small price to pay for everything else the Alloy Origins Core offers.

 Best of all, you’ll get an aluminum body and switches rated for an impressive 80 million keypresses, so it should serve you well for years to come. And if you want to customize your settings for different games, you’ll be glad to know that the keyboard supports multiple profiles.

_Razer_

| Pros                     | Cons                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Eye-catching design      | Typing can be noisy |
| Short actuation distance |                     |
| Programmable macros      |                     |

 Razer knows how to make premium gaming gear, and its years of experience are on full display with the [Huntsman V2 TKL](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Tenkeyless-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B09C13WYDX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904551&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). With an 8,000Hz polling rate for improved latency, the ability to save five onboard profiles, and a durable design, the Huntsman V2 TKL is ready for anything you throw at it.

 Everything about this board was designed for gaming. From switches rated for 100 million keystrokes to shine-resistant doubleshot PBT keycaps, Razer made sure the Huntsman V2 TKL was durable, reliable, and able to handle the rigors of competitive gaming. You’ll even benefit from an included wrist rest for enhanced ergonomics during extended gaming sessions.

 Of course, you’ll also have access to the usual assortment of RGB lights, allowing you to personalize the appearance of the Huntsman V2 TKL.

 A few different switch options are available (including Clicky and Linear), although some users might find them to be noisier than expected. Razer uses a variety of sound-dampening technology to mute the noisy behavior of its mechanical switches---but your mileage may vary depending on how “angry” you type and the surface you’ve placed your keyboard on. It’s a minor knock, but something to keep in mind if you share a game room with any family members or roommates.

 It’s a bit pricey at over $200, but the [Logitech G915 Lightspeed](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RMD5TP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904551&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best option if you’re looking for a wireless keyboard with little to no lag.

_Keychron_

| Pros                            | Cons                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Durable build                   | N-key rollover only supported in wired mode |
| Great for typists               |                                             |
| Multiple available switch types |                                             |

 Keychron makes tons of keyboards with Mac support, but the [K8 Wireless](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0869J8XD9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904551&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is among the best. Not only is it reasonably priced, but it offers everything you’d want from a premium mechanical keyboard--including brilliant RGB lights, a durable aluminum frame, and the availability of Brown, Blue, and Red switches.

 As you’d expect, the K8 Wireless features a Mac-specific layout, complete with Command and Option keys. But aside from full support for Mac, Keychron allows you to connect the board to up to three devices via Bluetooth---making it a great multiplatform tool for all your typing (or gaming) needs.

 The main drawback to the K8 Wireless is its support for N-key rollover, which requires a wired connection. If you’re using it wirelessly, you’ll only get 6-key rollover. That’s probably not an issue if you’re using it for word processing or browsing the web, but if you decide to play a game with the K8, you’ll likely need to set up a wired connection.

 But considering the K8 can run for up to 200 hours on a single charge, is rated for 50 million keystrokes, and includes extra keycaps if you decide to swap over to PC from Mac, there’s a lot of value packed into this responsive keyboard.
