## Gaming Deals Unleashed: Dive Into the Excitement of Steam's Seasonal Promotion!

Steam's seasonal sales are among the best places to grab yourself some savings on games, desktop hardware, and even a Steam Deck. Now, summer is rolling in, which means that Steam is going all out with its seasonal Summer sale. There's a lot to look at here in terms of both hardware and games.

 Steam has just announced the start of the 2024 summer sale, where the storefront will sell a lot of discounted games. Among the discounted games, we have options such as _Star Wars: Jedi Survivor_, which is down 55% from its usual $69.99 to $31.49\. _Cyberpunk 2077_ is down to $22.99, _Dead Space_ is down to $20.99, and _Spider-Man Remastered_ is down to $35.99\. Other games are enjoying of some even bigger discounts, such as _Batman: Arkham Knight_, which is down all the way to $1\. There is also some discounted software, such as Soundpad at $2.39â€”this allows you to play sounds in your microphone signal, so others can hear it inside a voice chat.

 In addition to this, the [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck#SaleSection%5F34993) is also enjoying some discounts as part of the Summer sale. Right now, both the 64GB and 512GB models of the original Steam Deck (with an LCD screen) are down 15% from their usual price point. This means that gamers that are interested in getting one of these consoles, but don't want to spend a whole lot of money, can take advantage of some decent savings. Valve had previously discounted them, but the discounts were about 10% off, so while these discounts aren't much bigger, they are certainly the biggest discounts Valve has offered to date. And while the [Steam Deck](https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-about-poco-m6-pro-4g-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/) isn't the most powerful nowadays, it still provides you with a pretty decent bang for your buck.
