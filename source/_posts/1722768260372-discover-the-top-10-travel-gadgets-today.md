## Discover the Top 10 Travel Gadgets Today

 Vacations are meant to be escapes whether you're lounging on the beach, climbing mountains, or jumping out of planes. The best travel gadgets can take the stress out of getting away while entertaining you for hours.

 These are our favorites.

 The 5th-generation iPad Air is a fantastic Apple tablet I own. It's fast and lightweight, with a beautiful screenâ€“what more could you ask for in a travel companion?

 If you want a specialized e-reader rather than using an iPad to read, Amazon's latest Kindle is the way to go. It has an easy-to-read 6-inch screen even in bright light, and it weighs just under 6 ounces (the iPhone 15 weighs a tad more.)

 Misplacing your belongings stinks, especially when traveling. Apple's AirTags can take away some of that stress, and with iOS 17, you can share them with up to five people to track shared belongings.

 When I'm traveling, I'm always worried about running out of juice in my various devices, and carrying around a million cords and adapters is a nightmare. (You should see my bag o' wires.)

 If you decide to bring that big bag o' wires, consider getting kit with organizing pockets (I'm considering it!) The Bellroy Tech Kit has a bunch of pockets and elastic loops to keep everyting secure and organized.
