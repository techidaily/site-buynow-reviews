##  What to Look For With a Phone Case in 2024

 Clocking in at over $1,000, purchasing a reliable case is a necessity for your Galaxy S24 Ultra. Finding the right one for your needs isn't easy, as there are hundreds of options to choose from—and not all of them are up to the task. It's hard to go wrong with trusted brands like OtterBox, Spigen, and Smartish, though every so often a smaller brand will surprise with an affordable, durable, case.

 Aside from sticking to trusted brands, the first thing you'll need to decide when shopping for a case is how much protection you need. Today's cases come in a variety of sizes. If you're prone to dropping your Galaxy S24 Ultra, consider investing in something rugged with plenty of grip. If you want something to protect your phone from scratches, you can get away with something much smaller. Since the S24 Ultra is already a large phone, you'll probably want to find something fairly thin, otherwise, it'll become unwieldy in your hand.

 Customization options are also worth considering when looking for the best Galaxy S24 Ultra cases. If you don't mind a simple black or clear case, you'll have plenty of options. But if you want something flashier or with unique patterns, your options become much more limited.

 Money is always a factor, and if you've already dropped over $1,000 on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, you may not be keen to drop $75 on a case. Thankfully, reliable cases can be found with a wide range of price tags. Rugged cases tend to be more expensive than their thin counterparts, though there are a few notable exceptions to this rule.

 Here's a look at the best Galaxy S24 Ultra cases to help you with your search. Whether you need something rugged and durable or thin and stylish, there's bound to be something that catches your eye.

 The below cases will only work with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra! They won't work with the standard [Galaxy S24](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-streamers-financial-compliance-check/) or [Galaxy S24+](https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-remote-desktop-capabilities-within-zoom-on-win11/) models, so make sure you have the right case for your S24 model before you buy.

##  Best Galaxy S24 Ultra Case Overall: [OtterBox Symmetry Series](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001832/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/trendy-galaxy-s24-ultra-case-black/77-94556.html)

| Pros                         | Cons          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Slim, protective design      | No port cover |
| Multiple colors and patterns |               |
| Raised edges protect cameras |               |

 The [OtterBox Symmetry Series](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001832/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/trendy-galaxy-s24-ultra-case-black/77-94556.html) isn't the most rugged case in the company's portfolio, but it's ideal for the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It offers plenty of drop and scratch protection without heaps of added bulk, allowing you to continue using the massive smartphone without it becoming unwieldy.

 Even though it's slim and compact (clocking in at less than 43 grams), it's rated for three times as many drops as the [military standard](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/are-opinions-on-goods-compensated-in-videos-for-2024/). Its polycarbonate and synthetic rubber construction is excellent at protecting against scratches, making it a well-rounded suit of armor for your phone. It also features raised edges, providing a bit of added security for your cameras and screen.

 Unlike other products in the OtterBox portfolio, this case doesn't feature a port cover. However, it's relatively affordable for the protection it provides, and you'll find it in a wide variety of colors and patterns. Toss in a limited lifetime warranty, tactile volume buttons, and the reliability of OtterBox, and it's easy to see why the Symmetry Series continues to be so popular.

Best Galaxy S24 Ultra Case Overall

#####  Otterbox Symmetry Series for Galaxy S24 Ultra

The OtterBox Symmetry Series adds impressive drop and scratch protection to your S24 Ultra without a bunch of added bulk.

The Optik Armor in front of an open doorway.

| Pros                         | Cons                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Retractable camera cover     | Limited color options                  |
| Minimalist design            | Quirky design won't appeal to everyone |
| Impressive price             |                                        |
| Wireless charging compatible |                                        |

 If you don't mind its unique design, the [Spigen Optik Armor](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Galaxy-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0CM4N9TZB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001832&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s24-ultra-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers a ton of value. Priced right around $20, it's a shockingly protective case for the Galaxy S24 Ultra and competes with products in a much higher price bracket.

 What makes the Optik Armor case unique is its sliding camera cover, allowing you to completely protect the rear camera block. You won't find this feature in many other cases, and if you're worried about scratching your lenses and messing up your Instagram phones, this is a great solution. The feature also makes the phone case look funkier than others, but it's hard to knock the product too much when it's so cheap.

 As you'd expect, the case supports wireless charging and is constructed with thermoplastic polyurethane and polycarbonate to create a durable shell. You're limited to just [black](http://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Galaxy-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0CM4N9TZB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001832&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s24-ultra-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [green](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Galaxy-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0CM57Z1GN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001832&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s24-ultra-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) color options, but shoppers on a budget would be hard-pressed to find a better case.

A person putting the Smartish Wallet Case in their pocket.

| Pros                        | Cons                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Unique, non-folding design  | Alternatives may offer more storage |
| Compact and sleek           |                                     |
| Holds three cards plus cash |                                     |

 It won't replace your entire wallet, but if you don't mind traveling light, the [Smartish Galaxy S24 Ultra Wallet Case](http://www.amazon.com/Smartish-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Wallet-Case-Credit-Card-Holder/dp/B0CMRDVV52?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001832&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s24-ultra-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the perfect compromise. Capable of holding three cards plus cash, it's a streamlined and protective wallet case that doesn't add too much bulk to an already massive smartphone.

 Instead of using a wallet flap, the Smartish case uses a hidden card slot that's built directly into its back. You can easily slide your cards out using the thumb notch, and a spring-loaded design ensures your cards stay snug while traveling. It's an innovative design—and one that works well with the Galaxy S24 Ultra's gigantic 6.8-inch display. When compared to a traditional wallet case with a flap, it's easy to appreciate its compact footprint.

 Multiple colors and patterns are available, and using the "Secret Menu" on Amazon, you'll gain access to an additional 15 designs. That should make it easy to find one that fits your personality. The case is also ultra durable, rated to withstand 50 drops at six feet off the ground onto concrete.

##  Best Rugged Galaxy S24 Ultra Case: [OtterBox Defender Series Pro](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001832/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/rugged-galaxy-s24-ultra-case-black/77-94638.html) 

![MixCollage-23-Jan-2024-01-14-PM-2405](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mixcollage-23-jan-2024-01-14-pm-2405.jpg) 

The OtterBox Defender Series Pro on a purple and orange background.

| Pros                         | Cons                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Reliable drop protection     | Bulky                 |
| Antimicrobial properties     | Limited color options |
| Raised edges protect cameras |                       |

 Unlike the Symmetry Series mentioned above, the [OtterBox Defender Series Pro](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001832/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/rugged-galaxy-s24-ultra-case-black/77-94638.html) is all about protection. The bulky case is designed to withstand just about anything you throw at it, though the added heft might be less than ideal for users with small hands.

 Where the Symmetry Series clocked in at around 40 grams, the Defender Series Pro is a weighty 138 grams. All that mass makes it great at keeping your phone safe, as it's rated for five times as many drops as military standard, putting it above nearly all other cases on the market. If the phone ends up being too big to put in your pocket or purse, you can always use the fashionable polycarbonate holster that's included with your purchase (it also doubles as a kickstand).

 Other standout features of the Defender Series Pro include antimicrobial properties to prevent the build-up of germs, a grippy texture that helps keep it from slipping out of your hands and raised edges to help guard your cameras and screen. Color options are limited, however, with only [black](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001832/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/rugged-galaxy-s24-ultra-case-black/77-94638.html), [blue](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001832/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/rugged-galaxy-s24-ultra-case-blue/77-94636.html), and [purple](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001832/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/rugged-galaxy-s24-ultra-case-purple/77-94644.html) currently available.

| Pros                                  | Cons                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Reasonable price                      | No port cover             |
| Durable polycarbonate construction    | Limited camera protection |
| Infused blue resin prevents yellowing |                           |
| Slim profile                          |                           |

 Infused with blue resin to prevent [yellowing](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/conquering-instagrams-video-challenges-head-on/) over time, the [Spigen Ultra Hybrid](https://www.spigen.com/collections/new-galaxy/products/galaxy-s24-series-case-ultra-hybrid?variant=41920567181359) is a great way to show off the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Along with blue resin, the case is crafted with polycarbonate for great protection against drops and scratches.

 Like most clear cases, this one from Spigen lacks a port cover and doesn't offer much camera protection. Its edges are raised to provide a bit of safety for your screen and lenses, though clear cases aren't typically known for their ruggedness. The trade-off, however, is that you're getting an ultra-slim design that's perfect for small drops or guarding against objects that pose a scratch risk to your expensive gadget.

 As you'd expect, it supports wireless charging and includes a cutout to let you easily access the S Pen. There are even a few variants that bring a pop of color to the case, with models available with [black](https://www.spigen.com/collections/new-galaxy/products/galaxy-s24-series-case-ultra-hybrid?variant=41920567214127) and [beige](https://www.spigen.com/collections/new-galaxy/products/galaxy-s24-series-case-ultra-hybrid?variant=41920593461295) edges. If you want to show off your new phone instead of hiding it behind a chunky case, the Spigen Ultra Hybrid is a solid choice.

| Pros                           | Cons                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 2mm thick                      | No port cover             |
| Military-grade drop protection | Expensive for a thin case |
| Dozens of patterns and colors  |                           |

 Dbrand is largely known for its lineup of skins, but its [Grip Case](http://dbrand.com/shop/grip/galaxy-s24-ultra-cases) is arguably a better way to keep your Galaxy S24 Ultra safe. It's still remarkably thin, yet offers additional scratch and drop protection—which is important for a $1,000 smartphone.

 Even though it's a case, dbrand managed to limit its width to just 2mm. It's also wrapped in a grippy texture to ensure it doesn't slide out of your hand. Toss in grip strips on the edges for additional finger holds, ridges around the cameras, and clicky button covers, and you've got a well-rounded case.

 The Grip Case is no slouch when it comes to guarding your smartphone, as it's rated to military standards for drop protection. Dbrand chamfered the lip of the case to give you full access to gesture navigation and a crescent design for easy edge swiping, so you won't have to worry about losing functionality just because you've thrown your phone into a case. All these features make the Grip Case quite expensive for a thin case, but it's a solid compromise between protection and profile.

| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Three color options     | Limited drop protection |
| Soft-touch materials    | No screen protection    |
| Protects from scratches |                         |

 Available in three different colors ([black](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fvegan-leather-case-for-galaxy-s24-ultra-black-gp-fps928hcabw%2F), [taupe](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fvegan-leather-case-for-galaxy-s24-ultra-taupe-gp-fps928hcaaw%2F), and [dark violet](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fvegan-leather-case-for-galaxy-s24-ultra-dark-violet-gp-fps928hcavw%2F)), the [Samsung Vegan Leather Case](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fvegan-leather-case-for-galaxy-s24-ultra-black-gp-fps928hcabw%2F) is a premium, stylish way to keep your S24 Ultra safe. It lacks the drop protection found on other products on this list, but it makes up for it with a luxurious finish that makes it feel more upscale than its price would suggest.

 Along with soft-touch materials on its exterior, the inside is also lined with soft materials to prevent any scratches from rough plastic or any debris that sneaks inside during use. Designed by Samsung, the case perfectly contours the Galaxy S24 Ultra, allowing you easy access to its gestures and S Pen.

 You'll likely want to invest in a good screen protector, as the case doesn't offer much of a lip to protect its massive display. But, overall, the Vegan Leather Case is a good choice for shoppers worried about scratches or anyone seeking a stylish way to guard their smartphone.
