##  What to Look for With Meta Quest 2 Accessories

 The Oculus Quest 2 (renamed to the Meta Quest 2 as part of [Facebook's rebranding efforts](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-best-8-stream-modifiers-for-flawless-webcam-videos/)) is a fantastic VR headset that makes for a perfect first step into virtual reality. But to make the experience near-perfect, some accessories will be needed to make the Quest 2 more comfortable.

 Since Quest 2 accessories are diverse, it's hard to provide blanket advice when shopping for one. However, accessories mostly fall into one of the categories below.

 First, there are accessories that make the Quest 2 more comfortable. These are generally replacement head straps, but other accessories, like a battery pack, can incidentally improve comfort as well.

 Speaking of battery packs, the Quest 2's battery life should be longer than most people want to be in VR. But if you need more from the device, there are battery banks that can be attached to the headset. Belt-clip packs are also a possibility if you don't want the extra weight, but they aren't that common.

 Link cables are an important type of Quest 2 accessory since this is how you can use your Quest 2 as a PC VR headset. They're not created equal, however, and if you get the wrong one, your experience may suffer.

 Finally, some accessories make the Quest 2 more convenient to use. Custom carry cases, charging docks, and wall mounts are good examples of this.

 Of course, some accessories do several of these things at once, but the point is that whenever you consider buying an accessory, it should improve your Quest 2 experience tangibly. When picking out accessories in each category below, we considered whether the product makes owning a Quest 2 a better experience and whether that improvement is worth the money. Purely cosmetic accessories don't make the cut!

| Great price                                          |                                                                                |

 The vanilla Quest 2 comes with everything you need to enjoy the VR experience, but the [Kuject All-in-One Accessories Bundle](https://www.amazon.com/Kuject-Accessories-Carrying-Charging-Controller/dp/B0BR3P17G7/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) takes an already great experience and makes it better in various tangible ways. This kit is exceptionally generous for the asking price, and there really isn't anything missing here, as far as we can tell.

 You'll get a carrying case, an elite-style head strap, a battery pack, a link cable for PC VR, a charging dock, controller grips, a face cover, and a lens cover. The quality of the accessories gets the thumbs up from most people who've tried it, which is always a good sign. One minor gripe seems to be that the touch controller slots [aren't perfectly snug](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLJV32HWJRFJA/ref=cm%5Fcr%5Fdp%5Fd%5Frvw%5Fttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BR3P17G7&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), but it doesn't seem to affect the overall functioning of the kit.

 The link cable is particularly interesting because a common issue with PC VR on the Quest 2 is that some PC USB ports don't offer enough power to keep the headset from discharging. The MT005 Link Cable in this kit has a charger passthrough, so you can connect your power adapter and ensure the Quest doesn't run its battery down during PC VR play.

 While each individual accessory in this kit may not be the absolute best example of its type out there, taken as a whole, this bundle is simply unbeatable from a value-for-money standpoint.

 If you are only looking for a good carrying case, we think this official [Meta Quest 2 Carrying Case](https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best of the bunch. Third-party cases tend to add pockets and spaces for items, but the official case is laser-focused on offering a compact case that holds just the Quest 2 and its controllers.

 After all, add any more features, and you begin to erode the "travel" credentials on offer. If you need a heavy-duty case or one that holds many accessories, you might want to opt for a [hard case with a foam interior](https://www.amazon.com/Casematix-Customizable-Compatible-Controllers-Protection/dp/B07S59ZSMN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It won't be very backpack-friendly anymore, but it will justify the added bulk thanks to higher levels of protection.

 But this minimalist official case is almost certainly the right choice for everyone who wants to take their Quest 2 out of the house.

 Headphones are always a contentious topic, and people have strong opinions on which types are the best. However, most headphones have to be fit for a specific purpose. The Quest 2 is all about freedom of movement and easy, comfortable access to VR whenever you want and wherever you are. A bulky set of headphones isn't the best choice to help with that goal, but luckily, the [Logitech G333 earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G333-Gaming-Earphones-Oculus-Quest/dp/B08DCLV85W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are specifically designed for the VR headset.

 The drivers have been tuned for VR applications, it has a durable yet light aluminum body, and the cord is precisely the right length. You don't have to deal with dangling wires with these buds.

 They are also available at a great price, and unless you want to invest in a high-end set of wired buds for general use, these are the best choices. If you are looking for an over-ear set, the [Logitech G PRO Gaming Headset](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G333-Gaming-Earphones-Oculus-Quest/dp/B08DCSBD1P?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) noise-canceling headphones will give you a comfortable and immersive VR experience.

| Provides a desperately-needed halo-strap solution for Quest 2 | Halo straps take longer to put on or remove |
| Solves the major comfort issues with Quest 2                  |                                             |

 For the Meta Quest 2, it's no secret that many users have comfort issues. This is partly due to how front-heavy the Quest 2 is, with a focus on portability. Thankfully, it's easy to replace the standard head strap the headset comes with.

 This means it's easy to install a replacement such as the [BOBOVR M2](https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-M2-Plus-Compatible-Accessories%EF%BC%88M2/dp/B0B3RWQZGS/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), a head strap design option the Quest 2 desperately needs. The M2 uses the "halo" strap design on headsets like the [PlayStation VR](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-understanding-and-adhering-to-soundtracks-legal-requirements-on-instagram/) and various Windows Mixed Reality Models.

 Halo-strap designs are by far the most comfortable way to use a VR headset since they more evenly distribute the device's weight across two large anchor points. The M2 goes further than even this by adding additional support points at the top of the head.

 It offers multiple positions and easy adjustment to get the fit just right. The only problem with the M2 and, by extension, halo straps is that it's not as portable as the standard strap and take longer to put on or take off. However, if you're going to spend extended amounts of time in VR, you're going to want something like the M2.

 The Quest 2 includes a glasses spacer and can accommodate most average-size spectacles. However, it's not always comfortable to wear glasses inside your Quest 2, and getting the focal length just right can be a pain.

 If you're sick of constantly fiddling with your glasses and the Quest 2, it may be time to consider buying a custom set of prescription lenses, and [VR Wave](https://www.vr-wave.store/products/oculus-quest-prescription-lenses-new) offers the best service. You can specify your lens needs and add optional coatings, and they'll send you a pair of lens inserts that attach using a clever magnetic system.

 These lenses are also easy to remove, so someone who doesn't need them can still use your Quest 2 comfortably. It's a great product, but you need a lot of information about your prescription to order the correct lenses. This means you'll have to [visit your optometrist to get all the various measurements](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-tech-to-preserve-classroom-interactions/) VR Wave needs to make them.

 Still, if you're looking to upgrade your Meta Quest 2 experience, it'll be worth the small hassle.

 You don't need a charging dock for your Quest 2\. You can plug it into the nearest USB-C charger and call it a day, but it's always nice to have a place to neatly put your headset away and display it. A charging dock can do that while actually having a use.

 What makes this [Anker Quest 2 charging dock](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Certified-Controller-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B08NDYQSXZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) special among Meta Quest 2 charging docks is that it offers a way to also recharge your controllers while you aren't playing. The included AA rechargeables and replacement cover plates make this possible. The unit is molded so that it matches the Quest 2 perfectly and makes it all look great.

 It also solves the problem of repeated USB-C insertions by using a dongle that's left in the Quest's charging port. This connector mates magnetically with a connector on the dock, making it a simple solution. Just pop your controllers and headset into this dock and forget about it until the next time you want to play.

 The only negative thing we can say here is that the price is pretty high, but then again, there isn't another solution as elegant as Anker's, either.

| Works with the standard and elite strap                 |                 |

 The Quest 2 Elite Strap with an integrated battery is a fine choice for Quest players who want more battery life before recharging. Still, we like the simplicity of the [NIVRANA VR power bank](https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Playtime-Improves-High-Speed-Charging/dp/B08XBC111B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 NIVRANA uses an open pouch design that attaches to the existing standard strap or the Elite strap. The included cable is the exact length needed to reach the Quest 2's charging port, and it's as simple to use as any standard power bank.

 You can charge both devices at once using pass-through charging. And when the included power bank does eventually wear out, you can replace it with a model of your choice, assuming it physically fits in the pouch.

This is a long, fiber-optic cable designed to get every byte out of a USB 3.1 connection and withstand years of twisting and turning that would wear out typical cables in much less time.

 We've used the Meta Quest 2 with various cables and have never encountered issues that make games unplayable, But this is the only cable guaranteed to give you perfect compatibility, and it will last at least as long as your Quest does.

 If you buy a cheaper third-party cable, you always run the risk of getting something that's incompatible with the headset. As such, the official link cable is the only USB-C cord we can recommend with confidence.

| Much cheaper than the official link cable | Does not have the peak bandwidth of USB 3.1 |
| Available in different lengths            |                                             |
| Tested and working with Quest 1 and 2     |                                             |

 While the Meta Link Cable is objectively the best cable to play PC VR games using a Quest 2, it's not the best choice for everyone. If your computer doesn't have a native USB-C port, particularly the VR-specific port found on some graphics cards, the true potential of the expensive link cable is wasted.

 If you need to use a USB-A connection, you might as well go for this [Anker Quest Link Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MZIPYPY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which is specifically designed for the Quest. Anker has also reinforced it for VR use in various ways so that it will last quite a long time as you twist and turn through virtual worlds.

 The only downside here is that you don't get those USB 3.1 speeds, but we have never run into any problems after more than 100 hours using [USB 3.0](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-methods-to-log-gaming-sessions/) on a Quest 2\. Even the Meta Quest 1's USB 2.0 cable is serviceable, albeit with lower visual quality thanks to compression.

 At the price Anker is asking for this charging cable, it's a no-brainer, and it has plenty of uses beyond VR too.

| Pros                                                                 | Cons                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Adds textured grips, making it less likely your controller will slip | Some users experience comfort issues |
| Adds knuckle straps alongside wrist straps for added safety          |                                      |

 If you use the wrist straps that come with the Quest 2, you should never get into a situation where your Quest controllers fly off and damage something. However, there are instances where intense gaming sessions cause grip problems that interrupt play.

 The [VR Cover Controller Grips](https://www.amazon.com/VR-Cover-Controller-Grips-Oculus/dp/B08MDV5YPC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) need to be used in tandem with your wrist straps, but they make it much less likely that you'll lose grip. The included knuckle straps will also help protect your hands.

 The Quest controllers are also a notoriously lousy match with sweaty hands, and the VR Cover grips help deal with that problem. Also, unlike your controllers, the grips are washable, so it's easy to keep things germ and sweat-free.

 It all looks and sounds good on paper, but a [small number of users](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQKJUE58QI?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768999%2Fbest-oculus-quest-2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) find that these grips aren't as comfortable as they could be. Since hands vary in shape and size, it's always hard for a product to fit everyone, but if they don't fit your hands properly, a refund on Amazon is a simple task.
