 Pros

* Lots of connectivity options
* Integrated beamforming microphone

 Cons

* Annoying red LED lighting

 Offering many features at a reasonable price, Creative's Sound Blaster Z is easily among the best PC sound cards you can buy. It comes with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 116dB and can output audio at 24-bit/192kHz, allowing you to enjoy high-resolution music in all its glory. It also has Audio Stream Input/Output (ASIO) support for reduced audio latency. The card's dedicated "Sound Core3D" audio processor enhances the overall sound/voice quality without taxing the computer's primary CPU.

 As far as connectivity and I/O are concerned, the Sound Blaster Z sports a total of five gold-plated 3.5mm audio ports and two TOSLINK ports, so you can connect everything from headphones to home theater system(s) and enjoy high-fidelity immersive digital audio. The PCIe sound card also comes bundled with a beamforming microphone that suppresses outside noise and creates an acoustic zone, thus resulting in improved voice clarity.

 Pros

* Affordable price
* Low-profile bracket ideal for small cases

 Cons

* No ASIO support

 Not everyone can (or wants to) spend a fortune on top-tier computing hardware, and if that includes you, ASUS' Xonar SE is just what you need. This budget PC sound card features a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 116dB and supports[high-resolution audio](https://www.lifewire.com/hi-res-audio-4134630) playback (5.1 channel) at up to 24-bit/192kHz. Its integrated 300ohm headphone amplifier creates an immersive sound output with well-defined bass.

 The card is manufactured using exclusive "Hyper Grounding" fabrication technology, which ASUS claims reduces distortion/interference and ensures better signal insulation.

 For connectivity and I/O options, the Xonar SE includes four 3.5mm audio ports, one S/PDIF port (with[TOSLINK](https://www.lifewire.com/digital-optical-connection-1846881) ), and a front audio header. A Cmedia 6620A audio processor powers the PCIe sound card and comes with a low-profile bracket that allows it to be installed in smaller cases without any issues. Its audio parameters can be easily configured via the companion app.

 Pros

* Handy controller unit with audio ports
* Individual amplification for each channel

 Cons

* Unintuitive software

 Hands down one of the most potent PC sound cards available, Creative's Sound Blaster AE-7 boasts a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 127dB and supports 32-bit/384kHz audio playback. It also has an integrated 600ohm headphone amplifier, working alongside the ESS SABRE-class 9018 Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to output rich (5.1 channel for speakers and 7.1 channel for headphones)[surround sound](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-surround-sound-1846802) .

 However, the card's best feature is its companion "Audio Control Module" unit, which allows you to adjust the volume level using a convenient knob. It also has a built-in microphone array, two 3.5mm audio ports, and two 6.3mm audio ports for hassle-free I/O and connectivity.

 The Sound Blaster AE-7 has five 3.5mm audio ports and a TOSLINK port. The PCIe sound card is powered by a dedicated "Sound Core3D" audio processor. You can adjust settings (e.g., recording resolution, encoding format) via its companion software utility.

 Pros

* Works with a multitude of devices
* Special gaming-oriented mode

 Cons

* Disappointing mic input

 Even though internal sound cards work great, they are limited to PCs because of their PCIe expansion bus interface. However, that's not an issue with Creative's Sound BlasterX G6, as it's powered via USB. This means that, besides laptops and desktops, you can hook it up to gaming consoles like Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. Featuring an integrated Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) and a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 130dB, it supports 32-bit/384kHz high-fidelity audio.

 The external sound card also includes a discrete 600ohm headphone amplifier, which amplifies both audio channels individually. For connectivity and I/O options, the Sound BlasterX G6 comes with two 3.5mm audio ports, two Optical TOSLINK ports, and a micro USB port. You get a single side-mounted dial to easily control gameplay audio and mic volume. The companion app can adjust everything, including Dolby Digital effects and noise reduction settings.

 Pros

* Lightweight yet premium design
* One-click Bass boost

 Cons

* Questionable long-term reliability

 Measuring around 3.14 x 1.93 x 0.82 inches and weighing just 2.75 ounces, FiiO's E10K is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. It's worth mentioning here that it's not a sound card but a portable[Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)](https://www.lifewire.com/external-digital-to-analog-converters-3134606) that can decode 24-bit/96kHz high-resolution audio without breaking a sweat. This is made possible by its new PCM5102 chip, which enhances the internal digital filter's linearity for superior sound output.

 You also get a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 108dB, while the new LMH6643 op-amp inside turns the unit into a 150-ohm headphone amplifier. As far as I/O and connectivity go, the E10K comes with two 3.5mm audio ports, a coaxial audio port, and a MicroUSB port. Some other noteworthy features include a convenient volume control dial and a slim aluminum case with a brushed metal finish.

## What to Look For in a PC Sound Card

**Audio quality** \- The overall audio quality of a sound card is a complicated equation that depends on the signal-to-noise ratio, frequency response, and total harmonic distortion. You generally want a sound card with a signal-to-noise ratio over 100dB, but the best sound cards are in the 124dB range, which is a significant improvement.

**Channels** \- Many decent, budget-friendly sound cards typically support 5.1 channel audio, but you can spend a little more to get one that can handle 7.1 surround sound. Some can even up-mix 5.1 channel audio to 7.1, which is excellent if your headphones support 7.1 channels and your audio sources donât.

**Connectivity** \- Look for a sound card with the jacks you need to plug in your equipment. Basic sound cards have 3.5mm jacks that work fine with most headphones and headsets, but look for one with RCA jacks or a TOSLINK optical connection if youâre hooking up to audio equipment that requires them.

 FAQ

* Why does my PC need a sound card?  
 Nearly all computers (desktops and laptops) available in the market feature integrated (on the motherboard) audio functionality, which ensures that both built-in (e.g., speakers) and external (e.g., earphones) work as intended. If you want to use your PC with high-end gear like studio headphones and home theater systems, you need a sound card capable of driving all this additional hardware. It's also crucial if you want to enjoy high-resolution lossless music.
* Should I go for an internal or an external sound card?  
 Generally speaking, internal sound cards are more powerful. They plug directly into your desktop PC's motherboard, offering features like switchable op-amp chips and many connectivity ports. However, external sound cards are the way to go if your target device is a laptop PC (or a gaming console).
* Can I install/set up the sound card myself?  
 Installing most internal sound cards isn't hard since you simply plug them into your motherboard's expansion slot. External sound cards are easier to set up since they usually get powered via a USB port. In both cases, you must configure the associated drivers (if any) to get things up and running.
