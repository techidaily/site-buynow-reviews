* The relaxing but repetitive background music.

 What We Don't Like

It sounds simple, but you soon find out that interlocking pieces cannot move until others move around them. It's challenging, it's unique, and it's addicting, all rolled into one.

_Unpuzzle 2_ is only available as a free-to-play game online. There are no mobile versions at this time.
