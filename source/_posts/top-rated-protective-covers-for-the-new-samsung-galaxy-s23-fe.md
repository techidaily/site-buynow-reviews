##  What to Look for With a Samsung Galaxy S23 FE Case

 If you're on the lookout for a protective case for your [Samsung Galaxy S23 FE](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Processor-Graphite/dp/B0CD99XXQY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001177&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s23-fe-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), there are a few important factors to consider. Naturally, picking something that offers strong protection against drop damage should be at the top of your list. Rugged cases such as the [Spigen Tough Armor Case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tough-Armor-Designed-SP64B/dp/B0BZTLWHQ4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001177&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s23-fe-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) provide Military Grade drop protection, while still maintaining the slim aesthetic of the Galaxy S23 FE.

 Next, consider how you want to be able to use your phone. If you value convenience with your phone and its accessories, you might prefer something that is MagSafe compatible and works with wireless charging. Something like the [Torras Magnetic Guardian](https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-Magnetic-Guardian-Protective-Translucent/dp/B0CCNZBSRS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001177&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s23-fe-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) can accommodate these features while still providing your phone a solid level of protection.

 There are plenty of compatible cases for the S23 FE that are engineered to provide enhanced grip for the user, making it less likely that your phone will slip from your hand, while also providing an attractive tactile experience. Price should be a factor for consideration too, as the most expensive cases available might not necessarily be the most effective for your needs.

 Whether it boils down to price, style, feel, or features, there's the perfect phone case for everyone. We've trimmed down the list of available options to bring you five of the very best to choose from.

| Pros                           | Cons      |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Military Grade drop protection | Expensive |
| MagSafe compatible             |           |
| Interchangeable color buttons  |           |

 If you're after a Samsung Galaxy S23 FE case that covers all the bases, you can't go wrong with the [TORRAS Magnetic Guardian](https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-Magnetic-Guardian-Protective-Translucent/dp/B0CCNZBSRS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001177&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s23-fe-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This slimline and translucent protective case looks and feels good, offers decent protection against drop damage, and comes with one or two unique features.

 This sleek phone case is fashioned with a coating that makes it feel great to the touch and also provides a high level of resistance against fingerprints and smudges. It's also been Military Grade ([MIL-SPEC](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/are-opinions-on-goods-compensated-in-videos-for-2024/)) drop-tested at heights of 12 feet and offers effective protection, bolstered by 360-degree surrounding airbags that provide shock absorption on all sides.

 Raised 1.5-millimeter bezels protect your phone screen and camera lens, and a textured grip means there's less chance of it slipping from your hand. Plus, this is one of the few Galaxy S23 FE cases that is [MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/) compatible, making it a practical and convenient choice for wireless charging.

 You even get a chance to personalize this case a little bit too, as it comes with three sets of interchangeable colored buttons, which can be easily switched up whenever you fancy giving it a fresh look. All in all, this is an excellent phone case that oozes style and is equipped with enough features to comfortably offset the comparatively high asking price.

 Proving that choosing a budget-priced case for your phone doesn't mean sacrificing style, the [Crave Dual Guard](http://www.amazon.com/Crave-Samsung-Galaxy-Shockproof-Protection/dp/B0CCBV6DY6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001177&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s23-fe-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is available in eight colors and has a cool, textured look that instantly appeals.

 It has a dual-layer polycarbonate and [TPU](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) design that offers double the protection and a comfortable textured grip that helps keep it firmly in your hand. A raised edge at the back keeps your camera lens guarded against drop damage, although protection for the screen itself is minimal.

 However, you'll find shock-absorbent corners, so as long as your phone doesn't land screen side down, the Dual Guard offers decent protection. Tactile button guards also feel good, so you can rest assure you can easily press the S23 FE's buttons while keeping them safe.

 With wireless charging compatibility thrown into the mix and for well under the 20 dollar mark, the Crave Dual Guard makes a compelling case for itself and your Galaxy S23 FE.

 Let's face it: accidents happen, and it's particularly unfortunate when it concerns our pricey smartphones. When the inevitable happens and your phone falls from your hand, you'll want the peace of mind that it will survive the impact. And if protecting your S23 FE ranks highly on your list of priorities, the [Spigen Tough Armor Case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tough-Armor-Designed-SP64B/dp/B0BZTLWHQ4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001177&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s23-fe-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of the best.

 Made from a mix of polycarbonate and TPU, this case utilizes Spigen's Military-Grade materials with shock-absorbing corners to mitigate damage caused by accidental drops. Moreover, you'll find a layer of shock-absorbing foam integrated into the case itself, adding extra protection to the phone's body.

 Raised bezels protect the phone screen and camera against scratches, and the case's coating is resistant to fingerprints and smudge marks. Yet despite all this reinforced protection, the case maintains a relatively slim appearance that won't add too much bulk to your pocket or bag.

 It's also fitted with a 70-degree kickstand that accommodates easy hands-free viewing in landscape mode. Providing excellent all-around protection without any of the usual associated chunkiness, the Spigen Tough Armor Case has you and your S23 FE covered.

| Pros                              | Cons                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Combines wallet with a phone case | Expensive                                        |
| Real leather                      | Minimal protection other than against the screen |
| Can be folded to make a kickstand |                                                  |

 If you love the feel of a real leather wallet but don't want the bulk of both phone and wallet in your pocket, the [TORRO Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCSJKBB1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001177&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-s23-fe-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) happily combines both. Mimicking the design of a traditional bi-fold wallet, there's plenty of space for your cards and cash here, and more.

 A strong magnetic clasp secures both halves of the case together, while the smooth wallet part protects your phone's screen. A raised bezel on the back keeps your camera protected, while the premium cowhide leather of the case itself adds a high-quality finish.

 There's a groove along the back of the case that acts like a kickstand when you want to watch videos or make hands-free video calls in landscape mode, and the case is wireless charging compatible as well. On the downside, there's no hard shell protection, as the TORRO case is all about the style.

 Nevertheless, this case offers a truly luxurious feel and successfully combines your wallet and phone case together, providing unrestricted access to all your phone's charging ports. You'll pay a premium for that luxury finish, but when it looks this good, you'll be pleased that you did.
