## Leading Handheld Gamers' Choice: Discover the Finest Portable Devices for Playtime

 If you love playing games like I do, you want to know there are plenty of ways to do so. Buying the best handheld gaming console means you can still play the latest games even if you’re traveling or the household TV is being used by someone else.

 I’m a big fan of the[Nintendo Switch OLED](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-White-Joy/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7C) , as Nintendo games are some of the best. It’s sufficiently lightweight to take, and the screen looks gorgeous. When I reclaim the TV, I can also connect it to the big screen via its accompanying dock.

**TL;DR:** Nintendo knows how to make great handheld gaming consoles with the Switch OLED the best of the bunch thanks to its great screen, huge amount of games, and lightweight build.

### Why We Recommend This

 It might not be the most powerful console around but the Nintendo Switch OLED is the one that I’m most likely to grab before heading out for the day. It has all the charm you’d expect from a Nintendo console. It takes seconds to start up, its menu system is easy to figure out, and its game catalog is fantastic.

 It’s starting to show its age with slower performance on some games but it’s worth the longer loading times.

 Pros

* OLED screen looks fantastic
* Extensive catalog of exclusive games
* Can connect it to TV

 Cons

* Hardware is starting to show its age
* No performance updates beyond the display

 Nothing about the Nintendo Switch OLED is clunky. The only ads you’ll see are for Nintendo services, so it’s very family-friendly. Game options include all your childhood favorites, including plenty of new versions of Mario, like Super Mario Odyssey and Super Mario Wonder, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the Legend of Zelda franchise.

 There’s some comfort here, but the Nintendo Switch OLED still has room for more adult games like Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy.

 You can[leave games in sleep mode](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-nintendo-switch-controller-5218934) so you can quickly resume where you left off, which is useful if you need to pause while traveling.

 Back home, you can plug the console into your TV via the included dock to gather around as a family to play multiplayer games or enjoy a single-player session on a bigger screen. This feels less essential solo than with previous Switches, as the OLED screen looks great, but it’s nice to have the option.

 Online play requires[Nintendo Switch Online](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784) , a paid service that offers emulated versions of old favorites from past consoles.

* **Who else recommends it?** TechRadar, Wired, T3, Tom’s Guide, Digital Trends, and CNET recommend the Nintendo Switch OLED.
* **What do buyers think?** 90% of buyers on Amazon have rated the Nintendo Switch OLED five stars, with the console having an average score of 4.8 out of 5.

[$450 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M) [$459 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Valve-Steam-Deck-64-GB/2237665775) [$399 at Steampowered.com](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck)

**TL;DR:** The Steam Deck makes PC gaming truly portable and much simpler than ever before. It’s all within a sleek and easy to hold shell with a great screen whether you go LED or OLED. As with the Switch, you can always dock it, and even install Windows if you want a full portable PC.

### Why We Recommend This

 The Steam Deck is effectively a portable PC. Designed like a Nintendo Switch, it provides easy access to your Steam library thanks to running SteamOS, Valve’s Linux-based operating system.

 While you might be thinking, a gaming laptop does all that, the Steam Deck is far more portable than any gaming laptop.

 Pros

* Highly customizable
* Huge range of games via Steam
* More accessible PC gaming

 Cons

* Battery life can be poor
* Customization can get very complicated

 Because the Steam Deck is built like a Nintendo Switch, it feels very portable. Its either 7-inch LCD or 7.4-inch OLED screen ensures you can see plenty of what’s going on without the bulk of a 14- —to 17-inch laptop screen.

 Due to its size, it won’t play games at the highest detail level but it still looks good and aligns well with the screen size involved. You can always dock it with your TV, like the Nintendo Switch, if you prefer.

 Regular PC gamers like me will already have extensive Steam libraries to explore, and there are often sales on the Steam store, meaning the Steam Deck can provide good value over time.

 Not every game on the store is compatible with the Steam Deck, but the number is growing rapidly.

 Technically minded people can also spend time customizing the device, either installing Windows to extend their options or other game launchers like Battle.net or the Epic Games Store Launcher. It’s fun to tinker with.

 Battery life could be better, but the Steam Deck truly is a PC in your hands, so that’s to be expected. Otherwise, it’s a lot of fun, and I’ve enjoyed catching up with my Steam library in a couch-friendly format.  

* **Who else recommends it?** The Verge, Forbes, IGN, PCGamer, and Wired have all recommended the Steam Deck with the Steam Deck OLED considered a particular highlight.
* **What do buyers think?** The Steam Deck has sold over 3 million units on the Steam website. Relatively recently featured on Amazon, it has 86% four- or five-star ratings across 564 reviews.

**TL;DR:** Old enough to remember the Nintendo Game Boy? This is a lot like that with plenty of nostalgic games on-board and more to be purchased separately. It’s perfect for anyone seeking nostalgia and it’s very keenly priced too.

### Why We Recommend This

 The Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket approaches the handheld gaming market differently from other consoles. It’s focused squarely on offering great retro gaming experiences.

 Pros

* Inexpensive
* Comes with good built-in games

 Cons

* Controls can be a little uncomfortable with larger hands
* No new games -- only old titles

 When buying, you have the choice of purchasing the Taito Edition, which comes with 18 games like Space Invaders ’91, Bubble Bobble, and The New Zealand Story, while a Capcom Edition includes 12 games like Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting, Final Fight, and Mega Man.

 As a retro gaming enthusiast, it was hard for me to pick the best game selection.

 Its 2.8-inch IPS screen is simple but provides a sharp-looking image as you play, while there’s a headphone jack and USB-C charging. It feels like holding a Game Boy, and it’s very lightweight.

 True to its name, the Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket fits in your pocket. The controls take a brief time to get used to, as they're quite close together and there are a handful of buttons on the back panel, but they’re reasonably well placed.

 The Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket is far more than just whichever edition you buy, as it also supports Evercade cartridges. There are over 45 cartridges available, providing access to over 500 retro games at relatively low prices.

 Titles include Duke Nukem, Tomb Raider, Flashback, and Pac-Man. There’s a lot of fun here, especially if you’re an older gamer.

* **Who else recommends it?** TechRadar, GamesRadar, Stuff, and The Guardian have all highly rated the Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket.
* **What do buyers think?** Between the two models, the Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket has an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Amazon. 84% of customers have rated the Capcom version 4 or 5 stars, with 90% rating the Taito the same score.

## How I Test

 I reviewed every handheld gaming console featured here over a number of weeks. The Nintendo Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and Steam Deck were purchased by me, while the Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket, and Logitech G Cloud were acquired on loan from the manufacturer.

 While playing them, I focused on how fun they are to use, how portable they are, and how user-friendly they are.

## Other Handheld Gaming Consoles We Considered

 The[Nintendo Switch Lite](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092VT1JGD?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7C) is the smaller and solely portable Switch option. It can’t be docked to your TV and has a weaker screen, but it’s cheaper and ideal for solo gaming.

Logitech G Cloud.

 The[Logitech G Cloud](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Handheld-Long-Battery-Touchscreen-Lightweight-Tablet/dp/B09T9FHZLH?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7C) is a device that allows you to play games via the cloud with ease.

## What to Look For

 Buying a handheld gaming console is a big decision. It’s important to consider what you want to achieve. What kind of games do you wish to play on it? Also, how portable do you need the console to be?

 All can be used away from a power source, but some handheld gaming consoles are easier to transport than others. Think about your budget as well, as prices vary significantly.
