 3D printing can feel very daunting for beginners. One reason for that is the many different types of filaments you can print with. PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU—it's a lot of cryptic acronyms. Thankfully, there are really only a few you need to know, and we'll explain what they do best.

##  PLA Is the Best Overall Filament

 When starting out with [3D printing](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-obs-full-screen-no-more-problem/), the first filament you should get familiar with is PLA (polylactic acid). This is, without a doubt, the most popular and easiest-to-use filament in the 3D printing world. Like all filaments on this list, there are pros and cons to PLA.

 First and foremost, PLA is the closest thing to a "it just works" filament. Nearly every 3D printer can print PLA without much configuration. It requires relatively low temperatures, doesn't need a heated bed, and can be printed and fairly quick speeds. PLA is also affordable, [comes in tons of colors](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-move-contacts-from-oppo-f23-5g-to-iphone-131415-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), and doesn't require an enclosure for toxic fumes (though you still may want to ventilate). It's the obvious choice for most things you'll want to print.

 On the downside, PLA isn't the strongest filament you can find. It can be pretty brittle under pressure, and it doesn't withstand high temperatures well. For example, if you tried to run a PLA-printed object through a dishwasher, it would likely deform.

##  ABS Is Stronger, But Be Careful

 The most popular filament behind PLA is probably ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene). Typically, people reach for ABS over PLA when they are printing things that need to be stronger and more durable. ABS will bend before breaking, and it can withstand much higher temperatures. One of the best features of ABS is its solubility in acetone—you can get a very smooth finish on ABS without hours of sanding.

 However, there are a couple of pretty big downsides to ABS. First, it's a bit more challenging to print with. Your 3D printer will need to have a high-temp print nozzle and a heated bed (most do have these features). More importantly, ABS releases toxic fumes while printing, so you absolutely need a 3D printer enclosure or a filtration system to use it safely.

##  PETG Combines the Best of PLA and ABS

 PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified) is most easily described as a filament with the characteristics of both PLA and ABS. It's relatively easy to print like PLA but also has the bend-but-don't-break and high-temp durability qualities of ABS. This makes it one of the best all-around filaments, as it doesn't have many downsides. However, there are some things you should know before loading it up.

 While PETG may be easier to print with than ABS, it's not perfect. The great layer adhesion properties make it more prone to clogging up nozzles. PETG can also absorb moisture from the air more than most filaments, which can cause problems if you use filament that's just been sitting out in the open. Lastly, PETG is more expensive than PLA and ABS.

##  TPU Is Best for Flexible Objects

 If you've ever purchased a case for your phone, you may already be familiar with TPU. It's a very common material found in thin, flexible phone cases, and [you can 3D print with it](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-bring-out-the-splendor-in-your-iphone-reflections/), too. TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) is not the only flexible filament you can use in 3D printing, but it is the most common.

 Not all TPU is the same. It's available in a wide range of colors and hardness ratings, which determines exactly how flexible the final product will be. You can print something as soft as a rubber band or as firm as an eraser. That variety is nice, but it does add complexity when you're trying to dial in the print settings. One common issue with TPU is stringing.

##  Less Common Filaments to Know About

 PLA, ABS, PETG, and TPU are most likely going to be the only filament you need to use, but there are plenty of other materials available. Here are a few extras you may want to know.

###  Nylon

 Nylon filament for 3D printing is known for its exceptional durability, strength, and heat resistance, making it ideal for functional parts that need to withstand wear and tear. However, it's trickier to print with compared to other filaments because it absorbs moisture easily, warping the prints, and requires a heated bed for successful printing.

###  HIPS

 HIPS (high-impact polystyrene) filament is a budget-friendly option with good impact resistance and easy post-processing. Similar to ABS, it can be dissolved to leave behind a smooth surface. However, HIPS can be brittle, flammable, and susceptible to some chemicals, and, also like ABS, it produces toxic fumes during printing.

###  PVA

 PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) filament is a great choice for 3D printing support structures because it dissolves completely in water, leaving behind a clean main print. It's also relatively easy to print at similar temperatures to PLA, but PVA is much more moisture-sensitive. It requires special storage, can clog your printer nozzle if not handled carefully, and is more expensive than other options.

###  Polycarbonate

 Polycarbonate (PC) filament is one of the strongest and most durable filaments on the market, making it ideal for functional prototypes and demanding applications. However, it's trickier to use because it absorbs moisture easily, needs to be printed at very high temperatures, and the filament can be pretty pricey.
