##  What to Look For in a Smart Bulb in 2024

 Among home gadgets you can control with your phone, smart light bulbs have been around for a while. Fortunately, this means that they've not only gotten steadily more advanced but more affordable as well.

 There are three primary considerations when shopping for smart bulbs. The first is whether the bulb produces colored or white light---or both. In general, white-only lights will be a bit cheaper than colored lights, but both styles are generally tuneable through a range of light temperatures and brightness levels.

 The second consideration has to do with the [receptivity built into the bulb](https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/why-my-videos-dont-show-repair-progress/). All of the bulbs on our list connect via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, a hub, or some combination of all three. If a bulb connects only via Bluetooth, it's important to remember that you'll only be able to control it when you are within a specific range. On the other hand, with Wi-Fi-connected or hub bulbs, you can access your lighting no matter where you are through your smartphone.

 Finally, you'll also want to consider platforms. These days, most---but not all---smart bulbs connect to the major voice assistant platforms: [Google Assistant](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-verizon-iphone-13-pro-by-drfone-ios/), [Amazon Alexa](https://common-error.techidaily.com/how-to-address-frequent-usb-connection-drops-and-keep-your-device-hooked-up/), and [Apple HomeKit](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-peeking-beyond-one-camera-limitations/). If you have one of these ecosystems already established in your home, you'll want to ensure the bulbs work well with it.

 You should also be aware that smart bulbs can give you a great degree of control over your room's ambiance. If you want the ability to turn lamps on and off either when you want or according to a particular schedule, you could consider [purchasing a smart plug](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/2-ways-to-monitor-huawei-nova-y71-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 Philips is a well-established brand in the smart bulb arena, and it's consistently delivered a wide array of reliable smart lighting products that are a breeze to set up, bright and customizable, and easy to use. With that in mind, it's no surprise that we picked the [Philips Hue Smart White Bulb](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-compatible-Assistant/dp/B07QWB3J8W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) as the best smart bulb for most people.

 Newer Hue bulbs feature Bluetooth, so you can connect and control up to 10 bulbs in one room through the [Philips Hue app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209601/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/explore-hue/apps/bridge). However, for full features, you have to buy a [Hue Bridge hub](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Smart-Google-Assistant/dp/B016H0QZ7I?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which lets you connect up to 50 bulbs throughout your entire home, add smart switches and motion sensors, and control lights when you're away.

 You can control the bulbs with Google Assistant and Alexa, or utilize the hub for more features and Apple HomeKit integration. Using the Hue Bridge hub also lets you set up routines, timers, and automations, which are helpful for indicating when it's time to wake up and go to sleep. Additionally, the hub can sync your lights with movies, games, and music for a more immersive experience.

 Philips Hue bulbs are some of the most expensive available, especially with the extra cost of the hub added on, but they're widely regarded as the most reliable, intuitive, and high-quality bulbs. If you intend to invest in smart lighting for your entire home, Philips Hue bulbs are worth their higher price.âââââ

A four-pack of Kasa Smart's color-changing bulbs comes out to about $10/bulb, making it easy to deck out your entire home with smart bulbs.

 Despite their budget-friendly price, these bulbs are capable of a lot. You can choose between warm and cool whites, change its color to one of 16 million choices, and dim the lights to set the mood. Or, set the bulb to automatically adjust the color temperature based on natural light patterns in your area.

 In addition to controlling brightness and color, you can create schedules to automatically turn your lights on and off at specified times throughout the day, use timers, or control your lights while you're away from the house. If you're on vacation, you can enable Away Mode and set your smart bulbs to turn on and off at random intervals.

 You can carry out any of these features using the Kasa Smart mobile app or via voice commandsâall without needing a hub. These smart bulbs are compatible with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings.

Ring

| Pros                                                            | Cons                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| â Impressive options for wired and solar-powered outdoor lights | â Requires Ring hub or Amazon Alexa to operate          |
| â Can integrate with Ring's larger home security ecosystem      | â Doesn't work with Google Assistant or Apple HomeKit   |
| â Works great with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant               | â Wired version could require professional installation |

 Ring, an Amazon-owned company, might be most famous for its [video doorbell](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-dueling-masters-topping-10-royale-clashes/), but the company also offers a dizzying array of smart outdoor lighting solutions. Our top pick from the company is its [wired outdoor motion-sensing floodlight](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Ring-Smart-Lighting-Floodlight/dp/B07KXBX65H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It's sturdy, bright, and relatively affordable.

 Although the Wired Floodlight will cost a bit more to install than the [solar versions](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Ring-Floodlight-Motion-Sensor-Security/dp/B082JYQN7X?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the latter has issues running out of power and not being as programmable as the wired models. It's better to pay a little extra for the reliability.

 All Ring products require a hub or [bridge](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Ring-Smart-Lighting-Bridge/dp/B07KXBX65F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which can be purchased with the bulbs as a starter kit that saves you some cash. Being an Amazon company, the lights only integrate with [Amazon Alexa](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-streams-for-gamers-unveiled/), so if you have a different voice assistant ecosystem in the home and voice control of your lighting is essential, you'll need to [choose a different setup](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-avchd-video-editing-software-top-recommendations/).

This network links the bulbs together, causing them to serve as repeaters so that even the bulb that's farthest away from your Echo can still be controlled via voice. If you don't have Amazon Alexa or an Echo set up yet, you can purchase a [Sengled hub](https://www.amazon.com/Sengled-Z02-hub-Smart-Hub-White/dp/B07HKSTLB5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that allows full functionality.

 When looking for smart bulbs, it will quickly become apparent that Apple HomeKit is not as widely supported as Alexa or Google Assistant. The [WiZ Connected Color](https://www.amazon.com/WiZ-Connected-Compatible-Assistant-Required/dp/B09G6TJVVC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of the few reasonably-priced smart bulbs that will work equally well with all three.

 After connecting the bulb to your Wi-Fi, it can be controlled through the [Home app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home/id1110145103) for iOS and iPadOS or the [WiZ app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wiz-connected/id1497247770). You can also use voice to manage the bulb via a [HomePod](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-proven-strategies-for-unveiling-pure-photospace-using-photopea/) speaker or Siri on your Apple device. If you ever decide to move away from an Apple smart home setup, the WiZ bulb can easily be added to the Alexa ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209601/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US), [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-alexa/id944011620)) or Google Home ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209601/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US), [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-home/id680819774)) apps.

 The WiZ bulb is multi-color and dimmable, with 16 million colors available. The color and brightness can be controlled manually through the app, or with pre-set lighting patterns that change automatically based on the time of day. There is also a vacation mode, so you can make your home look lived in even when you're away.

 The 8.8W bulb, equivalent to a 60W traditional lightbulb, is energy efficient and long-lasting. The rated lifespan is an impressive 25,000 hours, or 25 years if used for a couple of hours a day. It is only suitable for indoor use, but that isn't unusual for a smart bulb, especially one that costs just $13.

 Many smart bulbs say they have millions of colors, but Lifx goes one step further with billions of colors. It's a pretty hard claim to verify, but the fact is that these bulbs do indeed have a brilliant range of colors that fill your room with sharp, vivid light.

 Our top pick for this category is the [1100 lumen bulb](https://www.amazon.com/LIFX-Color-1100lm-Edison-Screw/dp/B08BKXPX3N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)\---which means it can get impressively bright---but you can save yourself some money and still enjoy vivid, colorful light by choosing the company's [800-lumen bulb](https://www.amazon.com/LIFX-Color-800lm-Edison-Screw/dp/B08BL16M81?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) instead.

 Lifx bulbs deliver all you'd expect from smart bulbs, including the ability to tune, schedule, group, use different presets to set the mood. Plus, they can be controlled with Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. No hub needed!

 Lifx also offers [smart bulbs that will beam out invisible infrared light](https://www.amazon.com/LIFX-Nightvision-1100lm-Edison-Screw/dp/B08BKZ8XRK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209601&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F735213%2Fbest-smart-light-bulbs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to provide any smart cameras in the room the ability to pick up video clips more clearly. So, stepping into the Lifx ecosystem can be a wise move if you're filming a lot of video content. Just make sure that the smart light can fit in your lampshade, as the wider bulb may not work in slimmer lamps.
