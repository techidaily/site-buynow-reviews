##  What to Look for in an iPad Case in 2024

 iPad cases are very useful. They not only protect your tablet from everyday mishaps, but they can also make it easier to grip the tablet or store the Apple Pencil. But not all iPad cases are equally good at everything. As a result, finding a suitable case for your lifestyle and usage can take time and effort. However, if you keep a few crucial details in mind, you will find the right case in no time.

 One of the most important things you need to decide is the level of protection. While we wish every single iPad case could offer top-notch protection, the more protection a case provides, the bulkier it is. So, finding the right balance between protection and bulk is a good idea.

 There is also a case to be made for [picking up multiple covers](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/artificial-intelligence-the-next-level-for-bing/) to suit different usage conditions. For example, you can have a thin and lightweight case for the home or office and a rugged case for outdoor activities.

 In other features, if you like using the [Apple Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MK0C2AM-A-Apple-Pencil/dp/B016NY7784?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and want to have it with you at all times, iPad cases that come with a built-in slot for the stylus are helpful. It's easier to lose your Apple Pencil if it doesn't have a dedicated storage place, and it's an expensive [iPad accessory](https://techidaily.com/guide-on-how-to-erase-apple-iphone-6s-data-completely-drfone-by-drfone-ios-full-data-eraser-ios-full-data-eraser/), so it's best to keep it safe.

 Price and design also play a significant role in any case purchase. While you don't necessarily need to sacrifice protection because of your budget, premium cases tend to use high-quality and better materials that last longer. Also, you will want the case to match your design and lifestyle sensibilities—otherwise, it will end up in a drawer somewhere.

 The cases below only fit the [10th-generation iPad](https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLCL22Y?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). They will not fit the other iPad models, including the [9th-generation iPad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or the [iPad Air](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V3JJT5D?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

##  Best iPad Case Overall: [Spigen Liquid Air Folio](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Folio-Designed-Generation/dp/B0B9ZTZDCQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Spigen Liguid Air Folio on purple background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/spigen-liquid-air-folio.jpg) 

Spigen

| Pros                                | Cons                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Slim and lightweight design         | Single color option                                            |
| Smoked transparent back looks great | The front cover doesn't stick to the back while using the iPad |
| The front cover doubles as a stand  | No Apple Pencil storage                                        |

 The [Apple Smart Folio](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smart-Folio-iPad-Generation/dp/B0BJLDDP6Y?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the default choice for many iPad buyers. Sure, it's well-made, easy to apply, and comes in many colors. But it's also not the most protective case. This is why we recommend going for the [Spigen Liquid Air Folio](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Folio-Designed-Generation/dp/B0B9ZTZDCQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) instead. It's a fantastic iPad case that doesn't add much bulk but can protect the tablet from scratches, bumps, and other bruises.

 Like the Apple Smart Folio, the Liquid Air Folio includes a front cover that can easily fold into different positions to double as a stand for your iPad. Its magnetic closure mechanism also offers smart wake and sleep functionality to conserve power and deliver a better user experience.

 Spigen has used flexible [thermoplastic polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) (TPU) to construct the back cover, which makes the installation easy, and the TPU can absorb the shock of an impact. There is also polyurethane and vegan leather on the front cover to ensure the screen remains guarded against any scratches. The back of the case also has a nice, smoked transparent look that offers a peek at the iPad design and colorway.

 Unfortunately, it's not all perfect For example, the Spigen Liquid Air Folio is only available in a single color option, and the front cover doesn't stick to the back of the iPad, so you'll have to hold it with your finger while using the slate.

##  Best Budget iPad Case: [ESR Case for iPad (2022)](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Compatible-Generation-Lightweight-Yellowing/dp/B0B6VFRCVK?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![ESR case and iPad standing up](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/esr.png) 

ESR

| Pros                                          | Cons                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Very inexpensive                              | Not a folio case        |
| Reputable brand                               | Only available in clear |
| Clear case allows you to see the iPad's color |                         |

 Most iPad cases aren't what we'd call expensive—and most of our recommendations will already be on the more budget side of the scale. When it comes to cases, spending more money doesn't always get you a better product. That said, there is always room to save just a bit more, and if you're on an extremely tight budget, [ESR's iPad Case](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Compatible-Generation-Lightweight-Yellowing/dp/B0B6VFRCVK?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will be the iPad case for you.

 Retailing at only $12.99 (and often on sale), this case ticks all the main boxes you'd expect. You'll get protection on the corners and back of the iPad, and the transparent case will let you see your chosen color, instead of covering up. It's also very thin, so you're not adding bulk to your tablet.

 However, you'll be giving up a folio-style case if you go with ESR's offering. While folio-type cases are more hit-and-miss with phones, many prefer a folio-style case for tablets because of its ability to protect the screen and other perks, such as a stand to use with the iPad. You won't be getting that here, so make sure you won't miss it before putting money down here.

TORRO

| Pros                     | Cons                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Genuine cow-hide leather | No space for holding an Apple Pencil |
| Four color options       |                                      |
| Can function as a stand  |                                      |

 The 10th-gen iPad may not be the most expensive tablet in Apple's lineup, but that shouldn't stop you from splurging a little on your case purchase. The [Torro Leather Case](https://www.amazon.com/TORRO-Case-Compatible-iPad-Generation/dp/B0BLZD37ZG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) uses high-quality top-grain cow-hide leather from US tanneries for a premium look. And like other genuine leather products, it'll develop a natural patina to appear even more beautiful over time.

 The TPU frame snugly fits the tablet and protects it from everyday accidents. Plus, the company has opted for a folio-style design, so you get a front flap that keeps the iPad screen safe from mishaps, and its microfiber lining keeps debris from scratches and scuffs.

 Unlike our other recommendations with a cover, the Torro case uses an elasticated strap to keep the flap closed. While it's not as seamless as a magnetic closure mechanism, it has a traditional charm. A strap is typically better at keeping the flap closed when you accidentally drop the iPad than magnets.

 Among other highlights, the flap has support strips to help the iPad stand for a hands-free experience. Moreover, you can pick between two horizontal viewing positions per your need.

Best Premium iPad Case

#####  Torro Leather Case

If you're looking for the best mix of a premium design, high-quality construction, and excellent protection, the Torro Leather Case is hard to beat.

[$70 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TORRO-Case-Compatible-iPad-Generation/dp/B0BLZD37ZG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

Logitech

| Pros                              | Cons                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Full-size keyboard                | Expensive           |
| Protects from scratches and bumps | Keys aren't backlit |
| Adjustable kickstand              |                     |

 If you're looking to make your iPad a productivity workhorse, a keyboard case is a great investment. For the standard iPad, your best bet is the [Logitech Rugged Folio](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Generation-Protective-Connector-Spill-Proof/dp/B0BJY11PZY?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 This case is built to last, first and foremost, exceeding military-drop standards. Given that this case has the keyboard to protect and the tablet itself, it's good to know nothing will break if the iPad takes a tumble. That also makes the Rugged Folio great for students on the go.

 As for the keyboard itself, you'll get a full-sized keyboard with quiet keys and a row of iOS shortcut keys, and you can even detach the keyboard if it's getting in your way. You'll also get a trackpad to control a cursor on screen, so there's no need to tap at the screen to open an app. Add an adjustable kickstand, and you have a case that can nearly do it all.

 That said, this keyboard case is pretty expensive, costing $139.99 when it's not on sale. It's not [Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) levels of expense, but it can be harder to justify the cost when the 10th generation iPad is very much meant to be a budget tablet option. But if you're looking to do more with your iPad, you can't go wrong with the Rugged Folio.

OtterBox

| Pros                                | Cons      |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| Military-grade drop protection      | Bulky     |
| Bundled screen protection and stand | Expensive |
| Slot for Apple Pencil               |           |

 The [OtterBox Defender Series Pro](https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Defender-case-iPad-10th/dp/B0BF5QWS2D?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) case doesn't mess around regarding protection. It's a high-quality, rugged case that will withstand everything life throws at it. The case also meets the [military-grade](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/are-opinions-on-goods-compensated-in-videos-for-2024/) drop test standards and can survive twice as many drops as the standard.

 It features a dual-layer design, including a polycarbonate frame and a TPU exterior. Raised edges protect the display and rear camera from scratches, and a port cover for the USB-C keeps dirt and dust at bay. In other features, you get a bundled stand that supports two viewing angles, and the case can also double as a cover for the screen when you aren't using the iPad. Moreover, the stand features a slot to house the Apple Pencil.

 Unfortunately, all this protection comes at the cost of the added bulk. The Defender Series Pro case weighs almost as much as the iPad if you include the bundled stand. You'll also need to pay a premium to get it, with the normal price being $52.

| Pros                                     | Cons      |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Meets military-grade drop test standards | Expensive |
| The Folio cover doubles as a stand       | Bulky     |

 UAG is no stranger to high-quality cases, and the company's [Metropolis SE Series](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Generation-Multi-Angle/dp/B09TG51MS3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for the iPad is a great example. If you frequently use the Apple Pencil, it's the case to put on your shortlist. It delivers rugged protection to your iPad and includes a nifty little slot to securely hold the Apple Pencil.

 Like many of our recommendations, it's a folio-style case, so there is a front cover to safeguard the display from scratches and drops. UAG says it can withstand 26 drops from as high as four feet and is tested to meet military standards.

 Other features include a tactile grip that makes it easier to hold and operate the 10.9-inch iPad. You will also be happy to know that the folio cover does the double duty of a stand and supports the auto-wake and sleep functions.

 Plus, the company highlights that medical-grade cleaning wipes or disinfectants don't damage the case. So, if you disinfect your devices regularly, you can rest assured that your iPad case won't disintegrate because of the disinfection spray.

SEYMAC

| Pros                                 | Cons                        |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Full device protection               | Not the prettiest iPad case |
| Includes a screen protector          |                             |
| Apple Pencil slot                    |                             |
| Wrist strap and adjustable kickstand |                             |

 There are many variables to consider when choosing a case for the iPad your children will use. Does it need to be easy to carry, guard against drops, protect the screen, or stand securely in landscape or portrait mode? Depending on your child's age, all of these requirements will likely need to be met. If so, the [SEYMAC iPad 10th Gen Case](https://www.amazon.com/SEYMAC-stock-iPad-10th-Generation/dp/B0BK8TY9KJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203727&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F846462%2Fbest-ipad-cases-10th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has you covered.

 The SEYMAC case offers full-body protection for the iPad, completely encasing it in hard TPU plastic and edged by silicone bumpers. It might look a bit bulky, but along with adding shock protection, those raised edges help make it easier for little hands to hold securely. Completing the defenses is a clip-on screen protector, which should also shield the screen from the almost inevitable accidents with food and liquids.

 On the back is an adjustable kickstand and hand strap, housed on a disc that can be rotated for landscape to portrait mode or provide a more comfortable grip. There's also a simple but effective loop to hold an Apple Pencil within easy reach and a couple of anchor points for the removable neck/shoulder strap.

 As you might expect, there are several color options available. These include kid-friendly greens, pinks, and even rainbow hues. If these are a bit much, don't worry—there's also a plain black version.

 It might not be the most attractive iPad 10th Gen case in the world, but child-proof protection is hard to make pretty. And despite its look, the SEYMAC iPad 10th Gen Case is one of the most cost-effective options for keeping your expensive Apple tablet safe from damage.

### How should I clean my iPad case?

 Smartphone and tablet cases can get dirty over time. So it's a good idea to clean them every once in a while. Remove your iPad from the case or cover before cleaning, and use a soft, damp, lint-free cloth to wipe it thoroughly. If it's too dirty, you can use mild hand soap with warm water to remove the stains or marks, but ensure that the soap won't harm the case material by testing it out in a small, hidden part of the case.

### Do speakers lose volume when using an iPad case?

 All good cases, including our recommendations, come with proper cutouts for speakers. As a result, iPad speakers don't lose volume when you are using a case. But if a case or cover doesn't have cutouts for the speaker, it'll certainly impact the sound quality and volume.

### What's the difference between an iPad case and an iPad cover?

 Although the terms iPad case and iPad cover are often used interchangeably, the two are slightly different. An iPad case refers to a protective accessory that wraps around the back and sides of the tablet, whereas an iPad cover also includes some screen protection, typically in the form of a flap.

### Can an iPad case cause overheating?

 A case can cause the iPad to overheat, but it's rare and mostly happens with rubber or latex cases that don't have any ventilation for the device to cool down. However, all reputed case manufacturers ensure that their cases won't make your iPad overheat and include the necessary ventilation.

### Are all iPad cases shockproof?

 All iPad cases are not shockproof. For example, if you're buying a thin, lightweight case, particularly one built without shock-absorbing material, such as TPU. In that case, there is a great possibility that your case isn't shockproof. On the other hand, most regular and rugged cases from reputed manufacturers have some shock absorption mechanism to ensure that the impact of a drop or bump isn't transferred to your iPad.

### Is an iPad case with a screen protector worth it?

 Screen protectors help keep the iPad display safe from scratches and scrapes. So an iPad case with a bundled or built-in screen protector can be a good idea. But it'll depend on the quality of the case and the screen protector. And you don't necessarily need to buy both things together. Instead, you can purchase a case of your choice and pick a screen protector separately. You will just need to ensure that the screen protector is case-friendly.
