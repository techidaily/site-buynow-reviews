##  What to Look For in Tablets For Kids in 2024

 Purchasing a tablet for a child requires careful consideration to ensure the device is safe, educational, and appropriate for their age and needs. Tablets come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Some allow access to the internet, some come with parental controls, and others are even more restricted.

 Therefore, one of the main priorities when choosing a tablet for kids to choose one that's age appropriate. Something like the [Amazon Fire HD Kids](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-launching-videos-efficiently-with-free-intros/) range is specifically geared toward kids, whereas the whole family can use an iPad. Thus, when researching kid-friendly tablets, you may want to consider finding one that includes parental controls to restrict access to inappropriate content, set usage limits, and so on.

 If you don't want your child to be able to access webpages or social media when on their tablet, you should look for a tablet that offers access to educational apps, games, and e-books that can help your child learn while having fun. There are plenty of ways to keep them entertained while avoiding the likes of Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube.

 Depending on your child's age, it's worth investing in a tablet that's size appropriate. Smaller tablets are better for younger kids since they are easier to hold. Larger tablets are more suited for older children and teenagers, offering a screen size and resolution that provides a comfortable viewing experience.

 Remember that while tablets can be valuable educational tools, moderation and guidance are key. It's important to balance screen time with other activities and to engage with your child's digital experiences to ensure they are safe and appropriate.

| Pros                          | Cons                                       |

 The [Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-tablet-1080p-Aquamarine/dp/B0BL953129/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) tablet is a versatile and child-friendly tablet designed to provide young users with a safe and engaging digital experience. Amazon recommends this model for ages 3 to 7, but it's also suitable for older children.

 Released as an extension of [Amazon's Fire tablet lineup](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-elite-recording-tech-top-10-cam-devices-windows-11-for-2024/), this Kids Edition tablet offers a combination of entertainment, education, and parental controls, making it a popular choice for families seeking to introduce technology to their children in a controlled and educational manner.

 With a 10.1-inch HD display, it's one of the best Amazon Fire tablets for children, backed up by 3GB of [RAM](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-unlocking-youtube-success-top-video-strategies-to-explode-views/), dual cameras, and up to 1TB of expandable storage.

 But, what makes the Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids a must-have for families is the 2-year worry-free guarantee and durable case. If the tablet breaks, Amazon says you can return it, and they'll replace it for free. This is a big plus since kids aren't always the most careful with electronics!

 The [Parent Dashboard](https://www.amazon.com/parentdashboard?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is incredibly easy to use, meaning you can filter content based on your child's age. You can also set educational goals, screen time limits, and offer access to other content like [Netflix](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/imovies-crop-technique-a-guide/) or [Disney+](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhancing-engagement-on-video-calls-using-snap-features/) under your control.

 Undoubtedly, kids of all ages will love the Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids. There are no social media distractions and no ability for your child to access the internet and browse websites. Instead, they can enjoy thousands of fun games, apps, books, and educational resources that will keep them entertained for hours.

| Pros                          | Cons                          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Not too expensive             | Performance isn't very snappy |
| Great battery life            | Poor cameras                  |
| Two-year worry-free guarantee |                               |
| Rugged case included          |                               |

 The [Amazon Fire 7 Kids](http://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Kids-Tablet/dp/B099HH3H2S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a tablet specifically designed for children, offering a combination of entertainment and educational content in a kid-friendly package. Similar to the [Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-tablet-1080p-Aquamarine/dp/B0BL953129/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), this tablet sports a smaller display at 7 inches, making it more suitable for younger children. But it also comes at a much lower price.

 When you purchase an Amazon Fire Kids tablet, you get one year of [Amazon Kids+](https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for free, which gives you access to thousands of games, apps, books, and content. It also comes with a rugged case and a two-year worry-free guarantee, so if your kid breaks it, you can get it replaced for free. That's great value for money on an already affordable kids' tablet.

 For children who enjoy using their tablet in the car or for longer periods of time, the Amazon Fire 7 Kids has a healthy 10-hour battery life, on average. Compared to the Amazon Fire 7 Kids 9th Generation tablet, it's also 30% faster according to Amazon, and doubles the amount of RAM.

 The included case has a handy stand that can easily be adjusted to suit your child. The tablet is easy to hold thanks to the non-slip material the case is made of. This makes car journeys much easier since the tablet won't fall to the floor (unless your child throws it down there, of course).

 Using the [Amazon Parent Dashboard](https://www.amazon.com/parentdashboard?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you can set screen time limits, educational goals, and more. You can also restrict content if you'd prefer your child not to have access to certain games or apps. However, the Amazon Kids+ subscription comes packed full of options to cater to children of all ages, and with up to 1TB of expandable storage, this is a future-proof option for your family.

Many could even consider it a [Chromebook](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/bargain-bin-of-the-clouds-spacious-file-staging-area-for-2024/) competitor.

 Powered by Windows, the Microsoft Surface Go 3 isn't too expensive when you consider it's a 2-in-1 tablet. But if you want to use this tablet for school or homework, you'll probably want to add the [Microsoft Surface Go Type Cover](https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Type-Cover/dp/B086QCKTMZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). If it's not on sale, it will cost you more than some budget tablets.

 Once you're all set up, this tablet is a great companion for kids in school or teenagers. It boasts a 10.5-inch display with a 1920x1080 resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio. You could easily enjoy movies, streaming services, document editing, and web browsing without any bother. And, with a bright screen and accurate colors, the Microsoft Surface Go 3 is great for [Zoom calls](https://howto.techidaily.com/8-ultimate-fixes-for-google-play-your-realme-12-proplus-5g-isnt-compatible-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/).

 Silent operation means this tablet can be used in class without disturbing others. You can't expect to do intricate Photoshop work or play AAA games, but it does a fair job for general productivity and word-processing tasks. It also offers excellent battery life, taking you from 9 AM to 9 PM with no difficulty.

 If you're looking for a child-friendly tablet for slightly older kids who would benefit from using one for school, the Microsoft Surface Go 3 is an affordable option. It comes equipped with Windows 11 and has a selection of accessories you can pair it with to enhance your productivity.

 At first glance, the [9th Generation Apple iPad](http://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09QHYRY98?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) doesn't seem to be much of an upgrade over the [Apple iPad 2020](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5Q255V?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). However, some key differences under the hood make it worth upgrading to or purchasing if you don't own an iPad. For example, it supports the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, runs iPadOS 15, and boasts Apple's A13 Bionic chip.

 While it's not the latest and greatest iPad, the Apple iPad 2021 does excel in many areas that make it a great tablet for older kids. It also offers incredible value for money, so all the family can make the most of it. You'll also have the option to choose between [64GB](https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09QHYRY98?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [256GB](https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0B5Z8JLTC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) versions and [Wi-Fi only](https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09QHYRY98?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [Wi-Fi + Cellular](https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0B8G7SM7J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Unsurprisingly, older kids might want to have video chats with their friends. The Apple iPad 2021 features an 8MP Wide back camera and 12MP Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage. This is perfect for keeping in touch with friends and family and ideal for taking photos while on vacation.

 Although the Apple iPad 2021 doesn't work with the newest accessories, it supports the [Apple Pencil (1st generation)](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-1st-Generation-Adapter/dp/B0BJLG69QR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). So, if you need to do homework, jot down some notes, or scribble a new drawing, you can easily do this. And, if you're worried about your child running into trouble with their new iPad, this option comes with [AppleCare+](https://www.apple.com/support/products/) for two years, for free.

 With a wealth of apps available to download on the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/), the Apple iPad 2021 is an investment for your older kids that gives them a little more independence. However, you can still access parental controls on any iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch to set content restrictions, prevent purchases, block explicit content, and more.

| Keyboard included       |                           |

 If you don't want to fork out on an expensive iPad, you could do much worse than investing in a more budget-friendly option like the [Lenovo Tab P11 Plus](http://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Tab-P11-Plus-1st/dp/B09B195RP1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904683&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablets-for-kids%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). With an 11-inch IPS display, [Dolby Atmos](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), and a keyboard included, you have everything you need in one package for you and the family.

 The Lenovo Tab P11 Plus is a great starting point for kids who prefer to use a larger tablet. It comes loaded with [Android 11](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-generate-stellar-podcast-title-ideas/), a MediaTek Helio G90T Tab Octa-Core processor, and 4GB of RAM. No, it's not boasting the best performance in a tablet, but it's an affordable choice for kids past the toddler stage.

 You can set up an independent kids account on this tablet and [Google Kids Space](https://families.google/kidsspace/). This opens the doors to over 10,000 apps and games that have been teacher-approved. There's also a great selection of books for your children to dive into. And for older kids, there's an 8MP camera for video calls and distance learning.

 For families with more than one child, you can easily create a separate user space on the tablet for each one. On the homepage, kids can choose from Watch, Games, and Read, depending on the type of content they want to consume. Using the [Family Link app](https://families.google/intl/gb%5Fus/familylink/), parents can set parental controls like screen-time limits, types of apps that can be installed, and so on.

 And, thanks to the included keyboard, parents and children can easily type on the tablet to make navigation a breeze. There's a lot to love here; affordable pricing, bundled accessories, and plenty of entertainment for all the family.

### What’s the best age to buy your child a tablet?

 There aren't really age limits when it comes to buying your child a tablet. However, Amazon's range of Fire Kids tablets recommends its models from the age of 4 and up. It's entirely at the parent's discretion, however, bear in mind that tablets are addictive, so screen time should be limited.

### Should I buy a case for my child's tablet?

 A case is a must-have for your child's tablet. A case can provide a protective barrier in case of accidental drops or damage. Many cases are also waterproof, ensuring your child doesn't damage their tablet in case of drink spillages.

### Is an iPad best for kids?

 iPads are great tablets, there's no denying that. However, they are better suited to older kids and teenagers. iPads tend to be larger than most children's tablets, and they are also much easier to damage, compared to the likes of the Amazon Fire Kids tablets.
