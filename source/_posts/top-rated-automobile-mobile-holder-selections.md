##  What to Look For in a Car Phone Mount in 2023

 While all car phone mounts solve the problem of propping up your phone for easy access while driving, they achieve this in different ways. Some use suction cups or adhesive tabs to attach to dashboards or windshields. Others have clips that grip onto air vents. A few are even designed to sit in cup holders.

 Your choice will depend on several factors, such as how close you want your device to be, your cabin's topography and material finish, and your state laws. That's right---some states have laws specifying where you can attach devices, especially when windshield mounted. Make sure to [check in with your local laws](http://blog.imagnetmount.com/windshield-mounting-laws-for-all-50-states-in-the-us/) before picking a car mount!

 Besides the surfaces to which they are attached, car mounts also vary in how they hold onto your phone. They could be magnetic, use spring-loaded arms, or even be [MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/)\-compatible for iPhone 12 and 13.

 Spring-loaded clamps are the sturdiest and can handle almost any phone, but they're relatively more difficult to operate---we've made sure to choose the easiest options, though.

 Meanwhile, using a magnetic mount is as easy as slapping your phone onto it and taking it off when done. However, they require you to attach a metal plate to the back of your phone or phone case, which isn't always pleasing to look at.

 Another factor to consider when choosing a phone mount is [wireless charging](https://change-location.techidaily.com/detailed-guide-of-ispoofer-for-pogo-installation-on-xiaomi-redmi-a2plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). You can get mounts with built-in Qi wireless support that get power from your vehicle's DC port, so you don't have to plug in your phone each time you enter the car.

 Most of the charging options are compatible with Android devices and iPhones, usually maxing out at 10W for the former and 7.5W for the latter. These charging speeds provide an excellent outlet to keep your phone juiced up on the move.

 Lastly, it's worth considering the maximum phone size a mount can hold to prevent your phone from falling off when you hit those pesky bumps. Smaller mounts with magnetic designs or MagSafe support tend to struggle with larger phones such as the iPhone 13 Pro Max, while larger spring-loaded mounts generally do just fine. With a spring arm, check the maximum extension width to ensure it's enough to hold your phone. And whatever you do, don't forget to factor in the size and weight of your phone case if you use one.

 The [Kenu Airframe Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q433TL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205537&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F812645%2Fbest-car-phone-mount%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is our choice for a mount you can use with your vents. It has a clip that securely attaches to AC vent slats with different orientations---horizontal, vertical, or angled. You press the buttons on either side of the frame to open the pinchers and then slip them over the vent slat.

 The clips are made of metal but are covered in a rubberized material to ensure they firmly grasp the vents without scratching them. However, there are [reports](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JKGQMSWH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205537&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F812645%2Fbest-car-phone-mount%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) that the rubber covering tends to wear out with time, exposing the metal part. This doesn't seem to happen with all units, though, so as long as you check the mount from time to time, the AirFrame Pro should be fine.

 As for keeping your phone in place, it uses a spring-loaded expandable jaw that's sturdy enough to hold even the largest devices on the market. No need to worry about your phone slipping out of place here! The ease of use makes the Kenu Airframe Pro stand out from most other options with the same design, as you can attach your phone to the mount with one hand.

 Meanwhile, the mount can adjust in two planes, a 360-degree rotation allowing you to place your phone in portrait or landscape and an approximately 45-degree tilt to the back or sides.

 If you want a car mount that'll sit on your dashboard, you'll want to grab the [Scosche MagicMount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I608BJ8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205537&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F812645%2Fbest-car-phone-mount%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). The small base uses an adhesive pad to attach to your dash. But despite its size, the bond is strong enough to keep the mount firm on smooth horizontal or vertical surfaces. Plus, the small footprint means that it can fit in many less practical locations---nooks, crannies, or crevices---making it more versatile than a suction cup.

 The MagicMount uses a magnet to secure your phone, although you'll have to slap a metal sheet on the back of your device. However, if you can look past that, the setup is even more adjustable than the [Kenu Airframe Pro](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/mastering-google-photos-your-ultimate-tutorial-for-2024/), thanks to its ball-and-socket design. You can see your phone perfectly whether you mount it on a sloping or vertical surface.

 As versatile as the MagicMount is, unfortunately, the adhesive pad is not great on textured surfaces. Also, you can't move it to a new location on your dash without getting a new pad. The latter is true for most adhesive products like the MagicMunt, but it's something to keep in mind if you need to remove the mount from its spot.

It attaches to your windshield with a powerful suction base that's easy to set up and doesn't lose grip over time.

 The iOttie iTap 2 Magnetic Mount can support many phone sizes, keeping them firm and steady. It uses a ball joint that allows you to rotate your phone 360 degrees between portrait and landscape orientations. It may not be as flexible as the [MagicMount](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-master-the-art-of-editing-your-tiktok-number/), but for many users, the iTap 2 will get the job done.

 It's important to note, though, that the iTap 2 is magnetic and requires you to attach a small metal plate to the back of your phone. The small size means it shouldn't bother you too much---if it does, you can try fitting it inside a thin phone case.

The impressive design makes use of a base with three clamps that can be adjusted to fit the width of just about any cup holder. Plus, the base is tall, providing enough traction to support the rest of the structure even with your phone on it.

 The product can handle many smartphones with its adjustable arms spanning approximately three and a half inches. With a one-key release system for controlling the arms that grip your phone, it's easy to get your phone in and out of the mount whenever you need to, even with one hand.

 Once in position, your device can rotate 360 degrees thanks to the motorized gooseneck. The neck is long enough to keep your phone at a reasonably high level, so it's easy to see, even if your cup holder is positioned low. However, if you have your car holders in an unusual spot, the mount might be difficult to use, so make reasonably sure the mount works with your car's layout before buying.

| ✓ Wireless charging for supported phones                                 | ✗ Doesn't support all phones |

 All the options on this list are excellent for holding your phone in a particular location or position, but you still need to plug it in to avoid draining your battery. However, the [iOttie Wireless Car Charger](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X4YDKTF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205537&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F812645%2Fbest-car-phone-mount%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) combines a mount and a wireless charger for your Qi-compatible phone to give you the best of both worlds.

 As far as charging your phone goes, the iOttie Wireless Car Charger can deliver up to 10W of power to supported Android devices and 7.5W for iPhones. The holder itself is versatile and available in multiple styles---dash, windshield, vent, or CD-slot mounts---so you pick this up no matter where you need to place the mount. Whichever you get, you can rest assured that it'll be sturdy and easily adjustable.

 For keeping your phone in place, iOttie has gone for a telescopic arm. The design features adjustable appendages that securely grasp your phone on either side. But for added firmness, the wireless charger also incorporates a two-prong base that can be pulled lower to accommodate taller devices.

 Despite that, however, the iOttie Wireless Car Charger cannot support all phone types. If you have a phone on the larger side, make sure the clamp can hold it before you purchase this mount!

 Apple's MagSafe technology usually achieves a secure connection between your phone and mount, but that counts for little if the attachment between the mount and car isn't stable. The clever way the [Peak Design Car Vent Mount](https://peak-design.pxf.io/c/156932/1609019/18669?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU205537&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Fvent-mount) attaches to the air vent slats helps to ensure connections are secure at every point.

 The mount has a silicone-coated vent grip, typical of many such phone holders. Above that, on the mounting plate, is the key to its stability: an adjustable hook that attaches to a second vent slat. When that is hooked up and tightened, the mount feels very secure, even if it does limit the number of vent styles it will fit.

 Just as importantly, this attachment method allows the mounting plate to be small so it doesn't block much airflow from the vent. That is an essential consideration if you live somewhere very hot or cold and must use the A/C or heater often. The 360-degree swivel arm makes it easy to rotate between landscape, portrait, or anything in between, and a ball joint lets you accurately adjust the screen angle.

 You can choose between a [wireless charging](https://peak-design.pxf.io/c/156932/1609019/18669?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU205537&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Fvent-mount) or [non-charging](https://peak-design.pxf.io/c/156932/1609019/18669?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU205537&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Fvent-mount%3Fvariant%3D40050758811725) version, both MagSafe-compatible. The [review of the Peak Design Car Vent Mount](https://www.reviewgeek.com/147744/peak-design-car-vent-mount-review-adjustable-yet-sturdy/) at our sister site Review Geek found that the wireless charging wasn't super-fast, but it still gets the job done:

 Depending on your phone, the wireless output is 5W/7.5W/10W/15W, which technically classifies as fast wireless charging. And while the wireless speeds are faster than much of the competition, or regular Qi chargers, it was still pretty slow on my Galaxy S22 Ultra. I'm guessing I got around 9-10W, but the phone display never said "fast wireless charging." It wasn't all that fast.

 Overlook that slight flaw, and the Peak Design mount is a great option for mounting your iPhone in your car.

### Do vent car phone mounts damage air vent fins?

 Some vent phone mounts can damage the air vents; however, these are usually mounts of poor build quality. Most vent car phone mounts will use rubber or other materials to make sure it will not damage the vents.

### Will my phone case prevent my mount from working properly?

 Generally not. The only time a phone case will interfere with a mount is if you're using a magnetic mount and the magnet is not strong enough to hold through the case.

### Do suction-based car phone mounts work in very hot or very cold weather?

 Suction-based phone mounts work fine in very hot weather. However, they do have difficulties staying stuck onto windows in very cold weather, as the rubber is less flexible and makes for a less effective seal.
