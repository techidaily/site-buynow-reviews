##  Buying DDR5 RAM in 2024

[DDR5 RAM](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-make-videos-in-minutes-wevideo-online-editor/) is both faster and capable of higher capacities than DDR4\. It also draws less power, so it's not just all about performance. DDR5 is relatively new and a clear successor to DDR4, so if you're building a new PC, make sure the build uses DDR5 RAM, for future compatibility if nothing else.

 While most new motherboards support DDR5 memory, you'll want to double-check while shopping. If you have an older PC that you're upgrading, check which type of RAM you have installed or what your motherboard supports to ensure you can use DDR5.

 Once you're sure you can use DDR5, you need to consider how much RAM you'll need. While 16GB and even 8GB builds are still relatively common, depending on what you're using your PC for, you may want to [opt for 32GB RAM](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/elevate-your-craft-canvas-hidden-design-secrets/). Depending on the capacity, you can opt for one stick or more or even go for a [dual-channel](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/prank-your-friends-easy-ways-to-fake-and-share-google-maps-location-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) kit.

 After capacity, speed is the next major consideration. Memory speed isn't too important if you're building a PC for general use or web browsing. That said, if you're building a PC for gaming, video production, or other more demanding workloads, you'll want to carefully consider the [speed and timing of the RAM](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-amplify-your-voice-on-youtube-mastery-through-tubebuddy/) you buy.

 If you're upgrading an existing PC, you want to ensure you match the speed and capacity to the already installed RAM, unless you're replacing it all. While it isn't as critical as the speed and capacity, ideally, it's also best to use the same manufacturer. If you don't, you run the risk of the RAM sticks not working well with one another, making your PC run slower than it should.

 Finally, depending on the PC you're building or upgrading, you may want other features. For gaming or other high-performance features, easy [overclocking](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-navigating-snapads-a-business-strategy-guide/) via features like [Intel XMP](https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/top-5-xiaomi-redmi-k70-bypass-frp-tools-for-pc-that-actually-work-by-drfone-android/) is nice to have, and you can also find RAM with software-controllable RGB features.

| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

 Ideally, DDR5 RAM offers powerful performance without costing you too much cash. The speedy [G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB Series](https://www.amazon.com/G-Skill-Trident-PC5-51200-CL32-39-39-102-F5-6400J3239G16GA2-TZ5RK/dp/B09QS2K59B?tag=htg-v2-4ho2nbc-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F895236%2Fbest-ddr5-ram%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) RAM meets both criteria, but it has a lot more behind it to earn a recommendation, especially if you're looking for the best performance you can get.

 We're looking at the 32GB package at a speed of 6,400MHz and a voltage of 1.40V. This model features support for Intel XMP 3.0 for easy, automatic overclocking of your RAM. However, don't feel left out if you're running an AMD CPU, as G.Skill also offers an [AMD Expo version of the Trident Z5 RGB Series](https://www.amazon.com/G-Skill-Trident-288-Pin-CL30-38-38-96-F5-6000J3038F16GX2-TZ5NR/dp/B0BF8FVLSL?tag=htg-v2-4ho2nbc-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F895236%2Fbest-ddr5-ram%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 With the Intel XMP 3.0 version of the RAM, you can get RAM timings of up to 32-39-39-102\. The AMD Expo version runs at a lower voltage of 1.35V and a lower speed of 6,000 MHz. This version has timings of up to 0-38-38-96.

 Either way, the 32GB version of this RAM comes as a dual-channel kit comprising two 16GB sticks. The Intel version is available in Black or [Metallic Silver](https://www.amazon.com/G-Skill-Trident-PC5-51200-CL32-39-39-102-F5-6400J3239G16GA2-TZ5RK/dp/B09QRFFXF9?tag=htg-v2-4ho2nbc-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F895236%2Fbest-ddr5-ram%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 RAM has come a long way, especially with DDR5\. It used to be that budget RAM was unreliable and often was tough to get working with your computer. That was a long time ago, and now RAM like the [Corsair Vengeance DDR5 5600MHz](https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-VENGEANCE-5600MHz-Compatible-Computer/dp/B09NCNF2ZQ?tag=htg-v2-4ho2nbc-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F895236%2Fbest-ddr5-ram%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) shows that buying budget RAM is nothing to sweat these days.

 Corsair aims to be as compatible as possible with modern PC builds, so you can count on the RAM working for you. To that end, the company actually hand-sorts chips and screens for the best performance and compatibility.

 This RAM features Onboard Voltage Regulation for easier overclocking. Thanks to Intel XMP 3.0 profiles, this is already an easier process. Add Corsair's iCue software, and you can overclock your computer's memory without even needing to access the BIOS.

 The Corsair Vengeance DDR5 has a limited lifetime warranty and is also available in [48GB (2x24GB)](https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-VENGEANCE-5600MHz-Compatible-Computer/dp/B09NCNF2ZQ?tag=htg-v2-4ho2nbc-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F895236%2Fbest-ddr5-ram%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [64GB (2x32GB)](https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-VENGEANCE-5600MHz-Compatible-Computer/dp/B09WN2H42Y?tag=htg-v2-4ho2nbc-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F895236%2Fbest-ddr5-ram%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [64GB (4x16GB)](https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-VENGEANCE-5600MHz-Compatible-Computer/dp/B0BLHG7FX5?tag=htg-v2-4ho2nbc-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F895236%2Fbest-ddr5-ram%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [96GB (2x48GB)](https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-VENGEANCE-5600MHz-Compatible-Computer/dp/B0BVN1FLKN?tag=htg-v2-4ho2nbc-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F895236%2Fbest-ddr5-ram%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) options.

 While you can get by these days running 16GB or even 8GB RAM, the time has come for 32GB. You may not need it now, but it's great for future compatibility, and DDR5 is here to stay for years to come. For a new PC build, you may as well start with 32GB of high-performance RAM, like the [Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB](https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-DOMINATOR-PLATINUM-Compatible-Computer/dp/B09R7TDMSW?tag=htg-v2-4ho2nbc-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F895236%2Fbest-ddr5-ram%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 The Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB is that while it does feature support for lighting effects, it doesn't look over the top. You can throw this in a workstation as easily as a gaming PC, and the onboard heat spreader will help it stand up to any workload you can throw at it, including overclocking.

 While the heat spreader helps, part of this thermal performance is also thanks to the Onboard Voltage Regulation, which helps keep you from pushing the RAM too far in terms of voltage and heat. This combined with Intel XMP 3.0 profiles means that getting the maximum performance out of this RAM is comparatively easy.

 Throw in Corsair's iCue software, and it gets even easier, letting you adjust memory settings and overclock the RAM without even having to boot into your BIOS menu.

## FAQ

### What does DDR5 stand for?

 DDR5 stands for “Double Data Rate 5,” as it is the fifth iteration of this memory standard.

### Are DDR5 RAM sticks AMD or Intel dependent?

 No. DDR5 RAM isn’t CPU specific, but there are manufacturer specific features like Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD Expo that can make for better performance on one manufacturer’s processor, depending on what the RAM supports.

### Can I use DDR4 RAM in a DDR5 slot?

 No, it won’t fit. DDR5 and DDR4 use completely different physical designs to prevent people from accidentally using one in the wrong slot.

### Can I mix DDR4 and DDR5 RAM in my PC build?

 No. Motherboards only support one type of memory, like DDR5 or DDR4\. As these are physically incompatible, you’re only able to install the type that your motherboard supports.

### How can I tell if my RAM is DDR5?

 If the RAM isn’t installed in the PC, this should be labelled somewhere on the outside of the RAM. If it’s installed in your PC, you can [check the type of RAM you have installed in Windows](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-premium-black-gopro-battery-units-with-official-chargers/).
