## Amazfit Helio Specs and Features

 The Helio Ring can track your resting heart rate, breathing quality, body temperature, and heart rate variability, which makes up your physical and mental recovery. You can view all your stats in the Zepp app.

 The ring can tell you how well you've recharged for another workout, if you need to take a break from working out, your sleep quality, how your body reacts to stress and your cardio fitness level.

 Zepp Aura can play sleep sounds to improve your sleep, and you can access an AI chatbot to ask questions about your sleep and get answers based on your sleep data.

 Zepp Fitness generates weekly and monthly fitness reports and includes an AI chatbot for fitness advice.

 At launch, the ring is available in sizes 10 and 12, but more sizes will be released in the next few months.
