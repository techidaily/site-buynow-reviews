## What Is a Gaming Console?

 Unlike a PC, which you can use for gaming, work, web browsing, and more, a console is solely focused on playing games. Key brands include Sony's PlayStation, Nintendo, and Microsoft's Xbox. Other consoles are available, such as the Steam Deck, other handheld devices, and VR headsets like the Meta Quest, but these three are the main ones to consider.  

 In all cases, a gaming console has a custom user interface. There’s also little need to maintain the system because consoles automatically download software patches for both themselves and compatible software. Gaming consoles are also more secure than a PC, so they’re ideal for less tech-savvy users.  

## 5 Things to Consider When Buying a Gaming Console

 It’s possible to buy any gaming console and enjoy it, but to find the perfect one for you and your needs, there are some key factors that you should consider beforehand.  

 Few consoles are inexpensive, so it’s useful to do a little research and learn what will be most enjoyable for you. Here are the five key things you need to think about before you commit to a new gaming console:

* Games
* Who the console is for
* Price
* Portability
* Longevity

## What Kind of Games Do You Like?

 Knowing what kind of games you like is the most crucial factor in deciding whether a console is right for you. That’s because not all titles are available on all platforms.

 If you love playing_Mario_ or T_he Legend of Zelda_ games, for example, you should consider a Nintendo Switch because those franchises are exclusive to Nintendo's platforms. Similarly, the_Halo_ and_Forza_ games are exclusive to the Xbox (and PC), while the_God of War_ and_The Last of Us_ franchises are tied to Sony’s PlayStation.

 Many games are available across all three platforms, with all the consoles having a wide range of titles to consider, but you will be restricted to certain franchises depending on your choice, so it’s important to think about what you’d enjoy.  

## Who Is the Console For?

 It’s also important to think about who the console is for because different gaming consoles appeal to different demographics. The Nintendo Switch is the more family-friendly option. Most of its games are suitable for everyone, with a handful of more violent and adult games also available.  

 Alternatively, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S are more adult with their game options. While you can find something like_Bluey_ on all platforms, for the most part, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S showcase games that focus on adult themes or content, such as the_Call of Duty_ franchise and_The Last of Us_ .

 Whichever console you choose, you get a strong mix of games and genres, but the Switch definitely leans toward family fare.

## How Much Should a Gaming Console Cost?

 Depending on the console you choose, you should expect to pay between $200 and $500 for one. It’s down to you and your budget as to what works best for you, although the more you spend, the more powerful the console.  

 Even a $200 console will play many of the latest games, though. Here’s an overview of prices on the latest consoles.

| **Price Range** | **What You Can Expect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $200            | For a solely portable experience, the Nintendo Switch Lite will suffice, but you can’t easily play it with others.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| $300 - $350     | For this price, you can buy the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, or Xbox Series S. The Switches are limited to 720p gaming, while the Xbox Series S can play at 1440p. Games are varied, and this is good middle territory for anyone who doesn’t need the absolute highest-tier graphics and sound. |
| $500+           | Able to play the latest games at the highest detail level and resolution, the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 are an investment and best suited for those with high-end TVs to connect them to.                                                                                                            |

 Only spend as much as you can afford. Also, keep an eye out for regular sales on these consoles to keep costs down.

## How Portable Do I Need the Console to Be?

 One key distinction between gaming consoles is their portability. Some, like the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, can only be used when connected to a TV or monitor and connected to a power source.  

 However, the Nintendo Switch series has a portable option. These options have a rechargeable battery and a built-in screen. The Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED can be connected to your TV any time you’d rather have a more traditional gaming experience, however.  

 Whether you need your gaming console to be portable depends on how you plan on using it. Only you know if you need to use it on the move, such as when commuting or traveling.

## How Long Do I Plan On Using the Gaming Console?

 Gaming consoles generally last longer than something like a[gaming PC](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-consider-before-buying-a-gaming-pc-5221042) . While a PC can soon feel dated due to aging hardware, you can still play an old game console, which is why retro gaming (playing old consoles) is a popular hobby.

 However, if you want to continue to play the latest games, it’s important to plan ahead. Current rumors suggest the Nintendo Switch will be followed by a sequel soon, but the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S are about halfway through their life cycle.

 Don’t worry too much about longevity. All of these consoles will still work after a new one is released, but you may find fewer patches and updates, as well as fewer new games coming out.

## Who Should Buy a Gaming Console?

 A few different groups of people will gain the most fun from buying a gaming console.  

* **Casual gamer** . If you just want to play a couple of games and don’t want the hassle of setting up a gaming PC, a gaming console is a good solution. There are free-to-play games like Fortnite and Apex Legends, as well as longer games.
* **Families** . If you have a family and want entertainment for everyone, a gaming console is a great way of bringing everyone together. Multiplayer games with couch co-op are ideal for the whole family without much setup.
* **Streamers** . If you plan on[streaming games through Twitch](https://www.lifewire.com/live-stream-on-twitch-5101696) and other streaming networks, it’s good to have variety by owning a console or two.
* **Experienced gamers** . You may like to mod games on your PC, but sometimes, the couch experience beats all and is very convenient. There are also exclusive games only available on console rather than PC.
* **Anyone with an aging gaming PC** . If you already own a gaming PC and it’s getting old, it could be cheaper to buy a gaming console than to upgrade your graphics card, memory, and other components. It’s more convenient, too, in some cases.

## What Should I Do After I Buy a Gaming Console?

 If you’ve just bought a gaming console, you have a few options for what to do next to enrich the experience. Here’s a quick overview of what to do next.

* **Buy a new monitor or TV** . Your standard TV will suffice at least for a little while, but it’s important to consider buying a new one or a dedicated gaming monitor. Such screens offer better refresh rates, HDMI 2.1 support for the latest consoles, and generally better picture quality. If you can't afford it, invest in a gaming screen to reduce motion blur or a picture that looks less than ideal.
* **Buy new peripherals** . A gaming console comes with the basics you need, such as a controller, but it makes sense to buy more. More controllers let you play couch co-op titles or avoid interruptions if your controller needs charging in the middle of a session. There are also subscription services like Nintendo Switch Online, Xbox Game Pass, and PlayStation Plus, which give you free games and the ability to play online. A gaming headset can also help if you want to talk to others as well as play more privately.
* **Get some games** . You need games for your gaming console. Check out the online game store for the console. There are usually free-to-play titles to check out, while the PlayStation 5 comes with Astro’s Playroom preinstalled. Other consoles may come bundled with games, or stores might offer bundles.

## More Tips for Buying a Gaming Console

 Before you go straight into buying a gaming console, there are a few other quick things to think about.  

* **Do you need a gaming console?** This can be a large investment, so make sure you'll actually use it before you lay down the cash. Will it just sit in a corner untouched after a day or two of excitement? Are there plenty of games available that you really want to play?
* **Would a gaming PC be better for you?** If you don’t really mind how you play and you work or create content from home, a gaming PC may be better. It can be used for all your work before being set aside for gaming time in your downtime.
* **Budget accordingly.** You’re not just paying for the console. You also need to consider the cost of the games, accessories, and things like subscription services. You’re in a lot of control here, and there are many good deals around, but you still need to assume you’ll pay more than just the basics.
