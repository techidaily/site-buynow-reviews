## 25 Unique Gift Choices Tailored for Every Android Fanatic

What does your choice of smartphone say about you? You may be asking that question if you're shopping for an Android user. The good news is people who like Android will probably like a [wide variety of techy gifts.](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-2023s-premier-entryway-toolkit-across-devices/) 

 The one thing you should avoid is buying them an actual [Android phone](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/) or tablet. They either already have the one they want or will want to pick out a new one themselves. However, you can add some peripherals to the mix and make their Android devices work even better.

##  A Great Pair of Wireless Earbuds
