 _We purchased Fintie Protective Case for MacBook Pro 13 so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

 Many believe that after spending over a thousand dollars on a[MacBook Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/update-macos-macbook-pro-4178508) , you’ll need to shell out a lot more money for a quality case to appropriately[shield your computer from harm](https://www.lifewire.com/protect-your-pc-with-windows-defender-3507028) . The Fintie Protective Case for MacBook Pro 13 defies this notion.

## **Design: Fetching and functional**

 This two-piece Fintie case is designed for the most recent 13-inch MacBook Pro models, with or without TouchBar. It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.

 Generous cutouts allow for easy access to all ports, and vents on the bottom of the case help to maintain airflow and keep your computer from overheating. Fintie offers a number of color and style options, from the Vintage Leather look that we tested to playful graphic prints and sleek solid colors.

 It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.

 The synthetic leather provides a comfortable grip, and that meant a great deal to us when we were assessing the overall utility of the case. It’s comfortable to walk around with it in your hands, and there’s enough traction in the synthetic leather to keep it from slipping in most cases. The Fintie also offers a host of other color and style options to allow for a little customization.

 One more plus? Contrary to some other options, this case is easy to put on and take off, fitting much like a second skin. It is loose enough to remove without a hassle and tight enough to effectively protect your computer. And the case doesn’t interfere with your use of the laptop at all.

## **Setup Process: No instructions needed**

 Once you’ve unwrapped this product, there’s no need to read any instructions—the case requires little setup. Just by looking at it, we could tell how it was supposed to be installed. We simply snapped the corresponding pieces onto the top and bottom of the laptop and we were done.

 It is loose enough to remove without a hassle and tight enough to effectively protect your computer.

## **Price: Low price, great construction**

 Given the value it offers, the affordable pricing of this case is another big perk. For just $18.99, this Fintie Protective Case for MacBook Pro hit on everything we needed in a laptop cover.

## **Competition: Fintie Protective Case vs. ProCase**

 As far as other laptop covers in this price range go, there are few that offer the refined design, utility, and price point of this Fintie case.

 ProCase’s MacBook Pro 13 Case is slightly less expensive at $16.99, but the Fintie blows it out of the water in terms of the quality of the materials used and the thoughtfulness of the design. Only Fintie combines plastic and premium synthetic leather to create such a low-profile case.

 It depends on how tight your budget is—there are other cheaper options, but the lower the price, the more you may notice a decline in quality. The Fintie Protective Case is something of an anomaly in that you actually get more than you pay for.

 Final Verdict

 **An affordable case that fits laptops better and provides more protection than the competition.**

 The Fintie Protective Case for MacBook Pro 13 is neither flimsy nor ill-fitting and is made from premium materials. If you want a case that protects your computer from scratches, dings, and the overall impact of minor drops, this one will certainly meet, if not exceed, your expectations.
