##  What to Look for With a Steam Deck Screen Protector in 2023

 Gamers know that their favorite hobby doesn't come cheap, and forking out for a Steam Deck is certainly no exception. So, having made the investment in Valve's portable handheld, the first thing you're going to want to do is protect that investment with a quality screen guard.

 Choosing the right kind of screen protector will come down to a few key factors. Prices can vary considerably, so you need to know what you're getting for your money. We recommend looking at the toughness factor and how resistant each screen protector is against scratch damage. Consider the level of transparency as well and whether this is likely to affect your gameplay or impair the responsiveness of the Steam Deck's touchscreen.

 Some screen protectors come with an installation kit that makes precise application easier, while others require a bit more elbow grease to line up and smooth out. With this in mind, you might want to choose one that comes with a second or even third screen protector to give you a vital second chance if the initial application doesn't quite go to plan.

 A premium screen protector offers unbeatable protection against scratch damage with an excellent level of visibility. However, this needs to be weighed up against the relatively high cost involved.

 In contrast, more budget-priced screen protectors are available and often come in multi-packs. However, installation is unaided, so you'll need a steady hand to place these perfectly. Additionally, you should expect the overall level of protection to be somewhat inferior compared to the more premium offerings.

 Whatever your budget, and however you're looking to use your Steam Deck, there's a screen protector to suit your needs. Once you've found the right one, you can fully enjoy the freedom of playing all your Steam favorites on the go.

| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| High resistance to scratch damage                 | Only one screen protector per pack |
| Includes auto-alignment tray for easy application | One of the more expensive options  |

 The [Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Steam Deck](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-Designed-Hardness/dp/B0BGQSZJTG?tag=htg-v2-4vvm2hu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000455&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a premium screen guard that comes with a price to match. That said, it's not quite the most expensive on the market, and it has plenty going for it in terms of what it offers.

 Let's get the bad out of the way first. This is a one-pack screen protector, so there are no second chances when it comes to successfully applying it. However, thanks to the easy alignment tray that's included, this shouldn't matter. Using a simple press-and-slide procedure, the EZ Fit Tray makes lining up and applying the screen protector a total breeze.

 As for the screen protector itself, it has a hardness rating of 9H, making it about as tough as screen protectors can get. Highly resistant to scratch damage, it also has an oleophobic coating that combats oily residues and fingerprints. It provides excellent overall transparency and doesn't impair the Steam Deck's touchscreen responsiveness.

 Custom cut for the Steam Deck, and with the only gripe here being the lack of an additional screen protector, the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector is a fantastic pick. And you'll hardly even notice it's there. You'll just be glad that it is.

 Retailing for almost $25, the [dbrand Tempered Glass Screen Protector](https://dbrand.com/shop/glass/steam-deck-tempered-glass-screen-protectors) doesn't come cheap. In fact, as Steam Deck screen protectors go, it's the most expensive option out there. Luckily, it's also one of the best. Plus, crucially, every purchase includes two screen protectors, which does soften the blow.

 A screen protector that screams premium quality, it has been precision cut to fit the Steam Deck's screen, nuzzling neatly against the surrounding bezel. It has a 9H hardness rating, offering serious scratch protection, and it also has that all-important oleophobic coating that protects against oily fingers and greasy smudge marks.

 This is an ultra-thin screen protector that offers unbeatable transparency. Once installed, the visual clarity from your screen is exactly the same as it would have been had you not installed it. Touch sensitivity is also great with this screen protector installed, with all your presses and swipes feeling fast and responsive.

 Installation is a manual affair here, with no fancy alignment trays to guide you in. However, to make things as easy and breezy as possible, dbrand provides alcohol wipes, dry wipes, and dust blotters to prime your screen for the application. The packaging also features a link to a [full instructional video](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2000455/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhIzhurIy7E) for anybody who may be hesitant to dive straight in.

 In terms of quality, the dbrand Tempered Glass Screen Protector is impeccable. And while the price may put you off, it's very unlikely that you'll need to replace this screen protector anytime soon.

 Premium accessories aren't for everyone, and you may feel that you don't need to outfit your Steam Deck with the very best of everything. If AAA protection isn't your thing, and you just want something that offers dependable protection as well as value for money, then the [Benazcap Tempered Glass Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/Benazcap-Protector-Tempered-Installation-Anti-Scratch/dp/B09PR8NBZZ?tag=htg-v2-4vvm2hu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000455&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) could be the one for you.

 It's been designed specifically for the Steam Deck and is cut to fit the screen's exact dimensions. You get two screen protectors in the pack, as well as wipes, cleaning cloths, and stickers to aid you with the manual installation. This screen protector has an impressive hardness rating of 9H, like the more premium screen protectors, and therefore offers robust anti-scratch protection.

 A hydrophobic coating helps to guard your screen against the odd bit of splash damage, and an [oleophobic coating](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-online-partnerships-crafting-brand-joint-ventures-on-youtube/) does the same against fingerprints and oils. This tempered film protects against blue light eye strains and headaches. The overall transparency with this budget screen protector is pretty decent, as is the touch sensitivity, though it can't quite match the more premium options.

 The main sticking point here is the ease of installation. It's not the easiest, and you can expect the odd air bubble here and there during installation. And while it's nothing that can't be carefully smoothed out, there are screen protectors easier to apply than this one.

 However, despite a slightly more fiddly application than its premium counterparts, the Benazcap Tempered Glass Screen Protector is still a high-quality Steam Deck screen protector at a very reasonable price point and well worth considering if you're looking to save a few bucks.

 If a fuss-free application is at the top of your wishlist, the [amFilm OneTouch Steam Deck Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/amFilm-OneTouch-Compatible-Protector-Installation/dp/B0BFB1P1JM?tag=htg-v2-4vvm2hu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000455&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) should get your attention. It comes with an auto-alignment tray and boasts an 'on in sixty seconds' easy installation.

 Lining up the plastic frame perfectly across the top of your screen is a foolproof endeavor. Thanks to its edge guards, it holds its position easily without any slippage. A gentle but firm press results in a perfect application with no bubbles or mess. However, should your nerves get the better of you, there is a second screen protector here for added peace of mind.

 As for the screen protector itself, it has a 9H surface hardness, as well as an ultra-thin 0.3 millimeter thickness. It offers a high transparency of 99.9% and skillfully wards off unsightly fingerprint smudges, thanks to its oleophobic coating. The surface is nice and responsive, too, and you shouldn't notice any significant loss in sensitivity on the touchscreen.

 Inside each pack, you'll find two screen protector kits (each with a screen protector preloaded), dust removal covers, wet wipes, microfiber cloths, and a QR code for an installation video. Everything you need for cleaning and prepping your screen to ensure no stray fibers or hair creeps in underneath to ruin your day.

 Applying a screen protector for your Steam Deck doesn't get any easier than with the amFilm OneTouch Screen Protector.

 Thanks to its portability, the Steam Deck combines your passion for gaming with a good, healthy dose of fresh air. However, if you're planning to enjoy gaming in the park on your lunch break, you'll want a screen protector that functions well in direct sunlight. Luckily, the [Ambison Matte Glass Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/Ambison-Protector-Fingerprint-Sensitive-Installation/dp/B09ZTHNC6L?tag=htg-v2-4vvm2hu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000455&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great anti-glare option for al-fresco gamers.

 Formulated with matte anti-glare glass, it is designed to repel light reflection, reducing any dazzling effects and enabling you to enjoy unhindered gameplay outdoors, even in strong sunlight. However, it is best used on the 64GB and 256GB models only, as the 512GB version already has a screen made with matte anti-glare etched glass; which renders this screen protector somewhat redundant.

 Besides its anti-glare properties, the Ambison screen protector carries a 9H hardness rating as well as an oleophobic coating to protect against fingerprints. Installation requires a steady hand, and you'll need to manually smooth things out to prevent any air bubbles from popping up. With two screen protectors in each pack, this isn't a big deal though.

 Offering a fantastically clear view even under challenging lighting conditions, the Ambison Matte Glass Screen Protector is the ideal choice for open-air gaming. If you already own an anti-glare 512GB Steam Deck, you will probably want to stroll past this one and look at an alternative. But for 64GB or 256GB Steam Deck owners, you should consider this screen protector if you're looking for anti-glare.

## FAQ

### Do I Need a Screen Protector for My Steam Deck?

### Will a Steam Deck Screen Protector Affect the Touch Screen?

 Most Steam Deck screen protectors are ultra-thin by design, with an average thickness of around 0.3 millimeters. You should not therefore notice any negative impact on the touchscreen's sensitivity.

### What Other Steam Deck Accessories Should I Consider?

 There are plenty of Steam Deck accessories to consider to get the most out of your handheld gaming. From sturdy carry cases to memory-expanding SSD cards, power banks to docking stations, as well as dedicated gaming headphones. And if you're looking to customize your Steam Deck's appearance, there are plenty of colorful skins to consider as well.
