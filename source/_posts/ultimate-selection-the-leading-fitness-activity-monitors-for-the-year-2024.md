##  What to Look For in a Fitness Tracker in 2024

 While picking a fitness tracker, considering your fitness goals is a good starting point. Are you a beginner trying to be more active, an enthusiast looking to make better sense of your workouts, or someone preparing for a marathon or something similar? The more specific your goal, the more specific features you'll need from your fitness tracker, which helps narrow down your search.

 In addition, you may want to look for features such as waterproofing, built-in GPS, and the ability to sync with your favorite fitness app, depending on your needs. If you plan on swimming, for example, you'll want a tracker that can handle being in the water to monitor your workout.

 Once you know what you want to monitor and how detailed you want the data to be, you can check for those features in your prospective fitness trackers. When you know what features you want, you can be sure to pick a tracker you'll want to use.

 Next, long battery life is vital if you work out frequently, for long durations, or if a lot of your fitness tracking will involve [GPS](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/how-to-access-and-understand-bios-on-windows-11-a-comprehensive-guide/). In addition, charge time is equally important. When you have forgotten to charge your fitness tracker, and you are about to start a workout, can you get a decent charge in a few minutes?

 Comfort is another critical aspect that you shouldn't ignore. If your fitness tracker isn't comfortable, it will end up sitting in a drawer somewhere. Also, if you wear it all day, you may want it to go well with your dinner attire or professional look.

 Finally, while many fitness trackers have some smartwatch features, you may want to [consider a full-fledged smartwatch](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-tutorial-on-how-to-cancel-and-retrieve-an-email-in-outlook/) if you want your fitness tracker to be a companion device to your phone. The [best smartwatches](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-poco-f5-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) generally have a good selection of health and fitness features, though a dedicated fitness tracker will give you more information.

##  Best Fitness Tracker Overall: [Garmin Venu 2](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-Advanced-Monitoring-Features/dp/B0911XHHCN?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![garmin venu 2](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/garmin-venu-2.png) 

Garmin

| Pros                                  | Cons                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Great battery life                  | ✗ Can't answer notifications on iPhone |
| ✓ Display easily readable in sunlight | ✗ Limited in smartwatch features       |
| ✓ Swim-proof and water-resistant      |                                        |

 Garmin is a well-known name in the fitness tracker industry, and for good reason. The company's smartwatches have been the main competitor of Fitbit for years now, and the [Garmin Venu 2](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-Advanced-Monitoring-Features/dp/B0911XHHCN?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) continues the tradition of being a fantastic, no-frills tracker.

 As to be expected from a fitness tracker, the Venu 2 will count your steps, measure your heart rate, and track a large number of workouts. There are even more advanced training modes, where the watch can help you target specific muscle groups and provide high-intensity interval training (HIIT) timers.

 But the real star here is the Venu 2's battery life, which can last up to six days if you turn off the always-on screen. When it comes to tracking health and fitness, you generally want to have the watch on and tracking as much as possible, so there's not much of a risk of the watch dying midday or mid-workout.

 It's important to note that the Garmin Venu 2 is a fitness tracker through and through, so you can't expect much in the way of smartphone features here. You'll still get notifications and Garmin Pay for easy purchases, but more advanced smartwatch features are absent here.

 If you're looking for the best fitness tracker, however, some missing smartwatch features won't be a deal-breaker, and you can buy the Garmin Venu 2 and be assured you'll get all the fitness data you need.

| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

 At under $100, the [Fitbit Inspire 3](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Management-Intensity-Tracking-Included/dp/B0B5F9SZW7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) packs too much into its slim frame to be ignored. Whether you're looking to track your heart rate, Active Zone minutes, calories burned, or sleep score, you can find it all on the Inspire 3's full-color Always-On display.

 Regarding fitness trackers, few things are worse than having your wearable die on you during your workout or while you're sleeping. Thankfully, the Inspire 3 has a battery life that lasts up to 10 days to make sure that doesn't happen.

 And while you're making use of that stalwart battery life during your daily swim, hike, or run, you can enjoy the additional functionality that comes with one free year of [Fitbit's premium subscription plan](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/services/premium).

 The upside: you'll have access to features like advanced sleep and stress insights, a Daily Readiness Score, and an in-depth understanding of what your health metrics mean for you and your workouts. The downside: it's only free for the first year. If you want to keep using the features Fitbit gets you hooked on, you'll have to shell out $10 every month after.

 Lastly, if built-in GPS is a must-have to track your bike rides and cross-country travel, you'll want to look for another option like the [Fitbit Charge 5](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Management-Tracking-Graphite/dp/B09BXQ4HMB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The Inspire 3 only offers connected GPS, meaning you'll need to use your smartphone in conjunction with the wearable for location tracking.

 However, if you're searching for a fitness tracker that won't break the bank but will give you everything you need for workout tracking and analysis, you can stop the search at Fitbit's Inspire 3.

| ✓ Swimproof                 | ✗ Heart-rate sensor is disabled |
| ✓ Tracks activity and sleep | ✗ Short charge cable            |

 If you are looking for a way to get your kids more active, the [Fitbit Ace 3](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Activity-Tracker-Astro-Green/dp/B08VKWCL22?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great option. It incentivizes having a healthy lifestyle by making fitness fun with motivational challenges.

 The tracker has a rugged design, ensuring it doesn't get damaged during playtime. In addition, it's water-resistant up to 50 meters and swim-proof.

 As you can expect, the Ace 3 is quite different from fitness trackers meant for adults. For example, it has animated clock faces and doles out virtual badges to make completing a fitness goal fun. The Ace 3 also allows children to challenge family members to step competitions so that everyone can participate and remain active.

 The usual fitness tracker trappings, such as the ability to count steps, track activities, and monitor sleep, are present. But all tracking is done passively, so kids don't need to do anything. The Fitbit Ace 3 also shines on the battery front with around a week on a single charge, making it fuss-free for parents.

 You can buy it in two color options—[Cosmic Blue with Green accents](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Activity-Tracker-Astro-Green/dp/B08VKWCL22?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Black with Red accents](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Activity-Tracker-Astro-Green/dp/B08VKX27ZV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)—but the company also offers a special edition [Minions Yellow version](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Activity-Tracker-Minions-Special/dp/B08Y94Z9RM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| Pros                                     | Cons                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Long battery life                      | ✗ Some features require a paid subscription |
| ✓ Built-in GPS and connected GPS support | ✗ No music control                          |
| ✓ Bright and clear display               |                                             |
| ✓ NFC for contactless payment            |                                             |

 The [Fitbit Charge 5](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Management-Tracking-Graphite/dp/B09BXQ4HMB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent fitness tracker that comes with a built-in GPS. You can track your walks, runs, and bike rides without your phone, which is especially freeing where we constantly need our smartphones on hand.

 The tracker supports over 20 workouts, covering everything from runs and swimming to pilates and kickboxing. It can automatically detect the most common workouts, and its top-notch tracking accuracy.

 You also get a heart-rate monitor, SpO2 sensor, temperature sensor, and multipurpose electrical sensors to track your sleep, stress responses, and vitals. This fitness tracker pretty much features everything you need for your health. In terms of smartwatch features, the tracker supports contactless payments and app notifications from your phone.

 The Charge 5 lasts about seven days on a single charge without an always-on display. But the battery life drops to half if you enable the always-on screen feature.

 Unfortunately, Fitbit wants you to spend money on getting a [premium subscription](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/services/premium) for features like Readiness Score and personalized insights. Fitbit has also removed Spotify support in the Charge 5, a feature available in previous Charge-series trackers. Keep this in mind if these are features important to you!

| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Tracks all the important health metrics  | ✗ No way to use most features without an iPhone |

| ✓ Software compatibility is second to none |                                                 |

 The Apple Watch line is the [best smartwatch line](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-poco-f5-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) around, so it should come as no surprise that the [Apple Watch Series 9](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Fitness/dp/B0CHX8SZQS?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the latest flagship offering, is fantastic. What may be surprising, however, is that this smartwatch also works well as a fitness tracker, giving you all the features you'd want from a smartwatch and tracker in one package—provided you have an [iPhone](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-quick-vimeo-transformation-tips-easy-to-create-gifs/).

 With the Series 9, you'll get a smartwatch that tracks all the vitals you'd expect from a fitness tracker, like steps, sleep, and heart rate. But where the Apple Watch rises above the competition is with its software support. The [Health app](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/) puts all of the information you get from your Apple Watch and more in one easy-to-read location. You can even upload medical data to get a clearer picture of your physical (and mental) health.

 In addition, the [Apple Fitness+ app](https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/) is one of the best fitness apps on the market, offering a large variety of workouts and intense for wherever you're at in your fitness journey. But the experience only gets better with an Apple Watch, where you'll get real-time feedback on your workout. That sort of data is invaluable, especially on the screen right next to your instructor—there is no need to look away from the screen and fiddle with your watch.

 Add in all the other features Apple Watch offers, and it's a hard recommendation to beat. Its only negative is a major one, however. The Apple Watch is, of course, part of Apple's 'walled garden' ecosystem, and it's even more restrictive than some of Apple's other products. You need an iPhone to pair the watch with, as you can't do it with an iPad or Android phone. In addition, you can't use the Fitness app at all unless you have an iPhone, even though you can watch the workouts on other devices after signing up.

 It's a frustrating problem for those who are Android diehards, but if you already have an iPhone, you can't do any better for a smartwatch than the Series 9.

[Whoop](https://join.whoop.com/en-us/) is one of the most exciting fitness trackers to arrive on the market over the last few years. It ditches the screen for a distraction-free experience and provides multiple ways to wear it, such as a bicep band or wristband. In addition, the company offers a range of athletic wear called Whoop Body that is fitted with pods to slot the Whoop tracker into.

 The latest iteration, [Whoop 4.0](https://www.makeuseof.com/about-the-whoop-4/), targets fitness enthusiasts or athletes who want to optimize their workouts. It takes a data-driven approach to your fitness and gives you the necessary insights into how you can improve it. You can read more about this in our [Whoop 4.0 review](https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-transform-your-videos-free-online-video-quality-improvement-tools/):

 It’s a fitness tracker for those serious about improving multiple aspects of their lives. In that regard, I would suggest this device is more of a life tracker to help people gauge how well their daily lives are in balance—between sleep, stress, and activity.

 Unlike most mass-market fitness trackers that report activity tracking data in steps taken or calories burnt, Whoop gives you cardio-vascular strain, recovery, and sleep performance scores. In addition, as the Whoop has all the sensors you will find on other trackers, you can get blood oxygen levels, heart-rate information, skin temperature, and respiratory rate data.

 Another significant way Whoop 4.0 differs from other fitness trackers on this list is the pricing structure. You buy a subscription worth $30 a month with a minimum of six-month membership to get the device and access to Whoop's app. You can save some money by opting for long-term plans, but there is no other way to get the tracker.

## FAQ

### How do I connect my fitness tracker to my Android phone?

### Does a fitness tracker track blood pressure?

A fitness tracker cannot track blood pressure. You need to use a [blood pressure monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Pressure-Automatic-Backlight-Irregular-Heartbeat/dp/B08QFSNNRQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206167&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F800000%2Fbest-fitness-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or cuff in order to track it.

### How do you charge a fitness tracker?

### How do fitness trackers track sleep?

Most fitness trackers will measure how long you're asleep, as well as the quality, using small motion detectors. These sensors will recognize when you're sleeping and how often you're moving to measure how well you're sleeping. Fitness trackers with heart rate monitors can also use your heart rate to measure your quality of sleep.
