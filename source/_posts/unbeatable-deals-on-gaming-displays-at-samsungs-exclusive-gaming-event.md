 If I had to pick one monitor to recommend, it'd be the [Odyssey OLED G9](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fmonitors%2Fgaming%2F49-odyssey-oled-g95sc-dqhd-neo-quantum-processor-pro-0-03ms-240hz-curved-smart-gaming-monitor-ls49cg954snxza%2F), also our pick for the [best ultrawide monitor](https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-handheld-panorama-peacekeeper-360-stabilizer-for-2024/). This 49-inch monitor is the very definition of 'ultrawide', but it's more than just looksâ€”with a 240Hz refresh rate, compatibility with G-Sync and AMD FreeSync, and an OLED screen, you'll be getting one of the best, if not _the_ best, PC gaming experiences around.

#####  Samsung Odyssey OLED G9

$1099.99 $1799.99 Save $700 

The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 is a fantastic super ultrawide monitor with impressive image quality, lightning-fast response time, and respectable HDR performance. 

[$1099.99 at Samsung](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fmonitors%2Fgaming%2F49-odyssey-oled-g95sc-dqhd-neo-quantum-processor-pro-0-03ms-240hz-curved-smart-gaming-monitor-ls49cg954snxza%2F) 

 Not only that, but you can also bundle the [2TB Samsung 990 PRO Internal SSD](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fmemory-storage%2Fsolid-state-drives%2F990-pro-w-heatsink-pcie-4-0-nvme-ssd-2tb-mz-v9p2t0cw%2F) (with a built-in heatsink) to save extra. The full price for this SSD is $264.99, but for Gaming Week, it's on sale for $199.99\. However, if you bundle it with a monitor, you'll save another $70, effectively bringing the price down to $129.99\. That is an incredible deal and well worth taking advantage of if you're grabbing one of Samsung's monitors this week. Even if you don't need it for your PC, the 990 PRO is also a great [PS5 SSD](https://windows11.techidaily.com/expert-level-insights-into-windows-non-adjacent-partition-integration/).
