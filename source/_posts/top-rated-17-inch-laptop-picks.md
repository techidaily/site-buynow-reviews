 Who doesn’t love a great deal? Most people know that one of the best places to find one is the quintessential American superstore, Walmart. On its user-friendly website, you can browse through laptops from some of the most trusted brands in computing, such as HP, Acer, Lenovo, Apple, and Asus. Don’t forget to look at Walmart’s tech value bundles to try and score an even better deal, or[consider buying a refurbished product](https://www.lifewire.com/things-to-consider-before-buying-refurbished-laptop-5235230) instead of a new one to save even more.

 Walmart offers a laptop buying guide and product care plans to protect your new electronics. You also can get compatible accessories, such as printers, mice, and carrying cases, and have them shipped to you in the same order. Plus, Walmart gives you a generous 90 days to return electronics, and they accept returns in-store if you don’t want to deal with the hassle of shipping an item back.

 It's been a debate for decades—Mac vs. PC? We're staying neutral, but you'll find the best selection on Apple's website if you like Apple products. Check out the newest products from MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, iMac Pro, Mac Pro, and Mac mini, plus accessories and the latest OS updates. Refurbished and clearance products are available, too, for those needing to find a good deal. Trade in your eligible device for an Apple Store gift card. If it's not eligible for a credit, Apple will recycle it for you for free.

 Free two-day shipping is available on all in-stock items purchased through[apple.com](https://www.apple.com/) . Or you can pick up most items—usually within an hour—from your nearest Apple Store, where technicians can help you set up your new devices. If you need to return something, send it back for free or drop it off at any Apple Store. For most products, you have up to 14 calendar days from receiving your items to initiate a return.

 FAQ

* Where is the best place to buy a laptop online?  
 If you're primarily an online shopper, you have no shortage of options for buying a laptop online. Amazon makes checking out multiple brands fairly easy, but we're also partial to other online retailers like Newegg and Best Buy. Most manufacturers like Apple, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and others have websites that you can buy laptops directly from, as well.
* Where to buy a laptop for the best warranty?  
 If the warranty is your biggest concern, your best bet is to buy a laptop directly from the manufacturer so you can take advantage of their warranty support and customer service. Other online retailers like Amazon have their own customer service and offer 30-day returns, but you'll still have to go through the manufacturer for any defects or issues that crop up later. HP and Dell are particularly reliable for warranty and support services, and Apple's widespread store footprint makes it easy to bring your MacBook in for repairs and servicing. The Best Buy Geek Squad also offers repair and support services, and you have the option of picking up extended warranties from them.
* Where are the cheapest places to buy laptops?  
 For those on a tight budget, buying directly from Apple or Dell may not be the best option. If you're willing to pick up a certified refurbished device, you can find plenty of options on Amazon. Alternatively, you can buy lightly used laptops from eBay, Swappa, Facebook Marketplace, and other secondhand selling sites. That said, you won't get a warranty and the purchase will be at your own risk, so your best bet may be to wait until a big sale such as back to school,[Black Friday](https://www.lifewire.com/best-black-friday-deals-2021-5083380) , or[Cyber Monday](https://www.lifewire.com/best-cyber-monday-deals-2021-5084041) .
