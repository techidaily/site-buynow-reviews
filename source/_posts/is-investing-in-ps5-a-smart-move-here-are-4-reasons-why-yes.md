## Is Investing in PS5 a Smart Move? Here Are 4 Reasons Why Yes
 Sony’s latest console picks up where its predecessor left off by providing a platform for playing many recent video game titles, while also supporting video streaming. If you get[the model with a disc drive](https://www.lifewire.com/why-the-ps5-with-disc-drive-is-the-one-you-want-5087498) , you can also play physical media, including movies.

 This guide will help you decide whether a PS5 is a good fit for you or the other game players in your life, depending on your preferences and situation.

## What Is a PS5?

 The PS5 ([PlayStation 5](https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394) ) is a video game console produced by Sony Interactive Entertainment and follow-up to the company’s previous iteration, the[PlayStation 4](https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452) . Much like its predecessor, the PS5 supports a large library of modern (and older) video games, some of which can only be played on the PlayStation 5 platform.

 The PS5 sports an eight core AMD Ryzen Zen 2 CPU along with 16GB of RAM and a Radeon RDNA 2 GPU to provide improved visuals and performance. The console supports 4K video (provided your screen can display in 4K), and can play 4K Blu-Ray discs if you get the model that includes the 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive.

## Who Should Get a PS5

 Think of the PS5 as one of your main choices when it comes to playing modern video games, alongside PC or an[Xbox Series X|S](https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-series-x-vs-xbox-series-s-5083862) . It’s something worth investing in if you:

* Play, expect to play, or want to play most big-name (a.k.a. AAA) video game releases as they come out. Examples of AAA series are_Assassin's Creed_ ,_Call of Duty_ , and_Grand Theft Auto_ .
* Are looking to upgrade from a PS4 or other eighth-generation (PS4, WiiU, Xbox One, etc) to more powerful hardware.
* Are enticed by any PS5-exclusive titles like_Demon’s Souls_ or_Spider-Man 2_ .

## Who Shouldn’t Get a PS5

 Despite the improved performance and visuals, plus some console exclusives, the PS5 isn’t for everybody. You can probably skip it if you:  

* Don’t have $450 to $500 to spare at the moment, or simply don’t want to spend that much
* Expect to install and play a lot of games but don’t want to pay an extra $100 or more for storage expansion
* Already own a powerful gaming machine like the Xbox Series X|S or a high-end PC
* Have no interest in any PS5 exclusives
* Don’t have much interest in playing the newest, most graphically intensive video games

## Why You Should Get a PS5

 Video games aren’t an essential part of life, but relaxation and entertainment (which games definitely are) can be very important. Not everybody needs to jump on the newest games as they come out, but here are some things that make a PS5 worth the investment.

### You Currently Have Another Sony Console

 Sony’s PSN ([PlayStation Network](https://www.lifewire.com/the-playstation-network-psn-817483) ) service is designed to work across many of its newer and older devices, including purchase and download histories.

 If you own or did own a PS4 and ever bought games digitally, you should be able to sign in on a PS5 and re-download them. It’s a great way to pad out your library without having to buy a bunch of new games right away—and sometimes those PS4 games have free PS5 upgrades.

### You Really Like Those Console Exclusives

 Anyone not mired in pointless console war bickering can tell you that the most important thing about a particular gaming platform is whether or not it can play the games you want. Many modern games are released across multiple platforms at some point (either all at once or over time), but they all have exclusives.

 In the PS5’s case, you’re looking at titles like the post-apocalyptic action series_Horizon_  , challenging dark fantasy action RPG_Demon’s Souls_ , or the superhero spectacle of_Spider-Man 2_ . If any of what’s out or what’s coming look like something you don’t want to miss, well, you probably won’t be able to play them anywhere else for quite some time. If at all.

### You’re Due for an Upgrade

 Hardware can only last for so long before the internal workings start to wear down in some capacity. Maybe your PS4 tends to[get too hot](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-overheating-ps4-5081993) or runs really loud. Maybe your console has been having trouble turning on, or shuts off at random. Or maybe you just want to move up to the next tier.

 Whatever the reason, if you think you’re ready to leave the eighth console generation (or older) behind, it may be time to get that PS5.

### Any PlayStation Plus Tiers Are Tempting

 The PlayStation Plus service offers more than just a way for you to online (though it does offer that, too).

 Each tier comes with progressively more perks and benefits—along with progressively higher subscription costs. At its more basic level (Essential) you can take advantage of special digital game sales and a handful of free full game downloads every month. You can play these titles as long as you're subscribed.

 At the next (Extra) level, you also get unlimited access to a digital Game Catalog of more than 400 PS4 and PS5 titles.

 The highest (Premium) tier adds PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5 on-demand streaming, full game trials, and a Classics Catalog of PS2, PS3, and PSP games.

## When You Shouldn’t Get a PS5

 As enticing as a new PS5 may be—especially when upgrading from older hardware—it does have its drawbacks and limitations, some of which might be a deal-breaker. Here are some reasons why you might not want to shell out for a PS5.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### The Price Is Too Steep

 While there are plenty of PS5 bundle deals out there, getting one can still be a budget-buster. Even factoring in the savings of a pack-in game or second controller, you’re still looking at a price of around $400 to $500 (andsometimes more).

 Despite the graphical upgrade and access to newer titles that older consoles simply can’t accommodate, it can be a tough choice to make when the PS4 or even the Nintendo Switch are available for hundreds less.

### You Already Own a Gaming PC or Xbox Series X|S

 The PS5 is a marked improvement over the PS4, certainly, but not so much in comparison to the Xbox Series X|S.

 The visual and performance differences between the two are fairly negligible, so unless any of the Sony exclusive titles really grab you there’s not much reason to also own a PS5\. This goes double for a high-end gaming PC, which in many cases will eclipse both consoles in all areas in addition to being upgradeable for even better performance in the future.

### You Don’t Want to Pay for More Storage

 One of, if not the biggest limitations with the PS5 is its[somewhat underwhelming storage capacity](https://www.lifewire.com/how-much-storage-does-the-ps5-have-7564130) .

 The unit comes with an 825GB solid-state drive, but really it’s more like 660GB of usable space. That may sound like a lot, but many PS5 games require anywhere from 30GB to 50GB or more. You’re either going to run out or have to start deleting things every time you want to download something new.

 It’s fairly easy to install a compatible SSD to double or triple your available storage, but doing so will require spending an extra $100 or more (in addition to having to open up the console).

### Backwards Compatibility Is Very Important

 Being able to play older games on your newer console is a feature many people prefer, and the PS5 does technically offer it, but not to the extent of its more direct competitors.

 You can[play a number of PS4 games](https://www.lifewire.com/backwards-compatibility-ps5-5084149) on a PS5 (from discs, too, if you own the model with the disc drive). However,[going farther back](https://www.lifewire.com/is-ps5-backward-compatible-with-ps3-5084152) gets trickier as not all discs will work properly, and not all of the older titles are available as part of a PlayStation Plus subscription.

## Do I Need a PS5 to Play Modern Games?

 Depending on any other means you may have available to play video games, a PS5 may not be necessary.

 If your computer is older or not intended as a gaming platform, or your consoles are from the eighth generation (Xbox One, PS4, etc) then yes, it definitely is. Many newer titles—particularly high profiles ones that aren’t console-exclusive—aren’t coming to older hardware these days.

## Will I Need to Buy a Bigger PS5 Hard Drive?

 Expanding the PS5’s internal storage space isn’t a requirement if you don’t plan to play an extensive variety of newer titles or don’t mind occasionally deleting things to make more room. That said, it’s generally much more convenient to spend the extra money and effort to add a compatible SSD so that you don’t have to worry about it—or at least worry about it less often.

## Is it Worth Getting a PS5 Slim?

 The[PS5 Slim](https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-slim-7966360) is essentially just the PS5 but narrower (hence the name) with no real difference in terms of power or performance. It carries a similar $449 (no disc drive) to $499 (disc drive) MSRP as well, though some non-slim models are available for the same price with a pack-in game for a slightly better value.

 Unless you find a bundle you really like or are particularly fond of the thicker design, there’s not much reason to opt for the older model over the PS5 Slim. The Slim is easier to fit on a shelf or in an entertainment center and comes with a slightly larger 1TB SSD (over the older model’s 825GB).

 Additionally, if you go for the less costly digital-only model with no disc drive, you do have the option to purchase ($79.99) and install a disc drive later if you change your mind.

 Eventually, you won't have a choice about whether or not to get a Slim version. Once Sony sells through the older, larger models, this will be the only option.

## Should I Wait for the PS5 Pro?

 Deciding whether or not to hold off on getting a PS5 or PS5 Slim in favor of the[PS5 Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-pro-7966359) is a tricky proposition because this expected iteration doesn’t technically exist yet. At least not officially.  

 None of this has been officially verified as of yet, but if the rumors are true then the PS5 Pro is expected to provide close to 30% higher performance over the regular or Slim models. There’s also talk of GPU rendering that’s about 45% faster, along with 8K video support.

 With an estimated release price of $499 for the digital version and $599 for the model with a disc drive, it might be with a bit more of a wait.
