 Do you want to enjoy your favorite Netflix shows and movies with your friends? If so, one way to do that is to [stream Netflix on your Discord server](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-for-students-discover-the-top-10-historical-youtube-channels-now/). You can do this even when you're on Discord's free plan. We'll show you how.

##  Can You Stream Netflix on Discord?

 You can stream Netflix on Discord as long as you meet the minimum requirements for doing so.

 The first requirement that goes without saying is you must [have an active Netflix plan](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/breaking-down-and-solving-an-unresponsive-epson-on-windows-11/). Secondly, you need a Discord server where you can stream your content. You can [create your own server](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-seamless-music-addition-for-social-media-iphoneandroid/) if you don't already have access to one. You do not need a Nitro subscription to stream Netflix on Discord, but without one your stream quality will be limited.

 With all of those requirements met, you can simply access Netflix in your Windows or Mac machine's web browser and stream that browser's contents on your Discord server.

##  How to Screen Share Netflix on Discord

 To begin playing Netflix's content on Discord, first, launch your preferred web browser on your Windows or Mac computer and access the [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) site. Sign in to your account on the site.

 Keep your web browser running in the background and launch the Discord app. In the app's bottom-left corner, select the gear icon, which opens User Settings. After that, select "Registered Games" in the left sidebar. In the right pane, choose "Add It."

 In the box that opens, click the "Select" drop-down menu and choose your open web browser.

Close 

 Press Esc to close the Discord settings window.

 On Discord's main screen, in the left sidebar, join the server in which you want to stream Netflix. Then, in the app's bottom-left corner, click the monitor icon next to your web browser.

![Click the stream icon in the bottom left corner.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6-click-the-stream-icon.png) 

 You'll see a "Screen Share" window. Here, click the "Select a Voice Channel" menu and choose the channel in which you want to start the stream. Choose the desired streaming resolution and FPS (frames-per-second) in the "Stream Quality" section.

 If you'd like to stream your content in 1080p or 60 FPS, you'll need a [Discord Nitro subscription](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/forgot-apple-iphone-12-mini-backup-password-heres-what-to-do-by-drfone-ios/), which costs $9.99/month if you pay monthly ($99.99 per year if you pay annually) as of May 2024.

 To begin streaming, at the bottom of the "Screen Share" window, click "Go Live."

 You'll see a floating window on your screen, letting you watch your Netflix stream on Discord.

 When you'd like to stop streaming, then in the floating window's bottom-right corner, click the "X" icon. You can also click the X in the bottom right corner of the Discord window.

##  Fix the Black Screen Issue While Streaming Netflix on Discord

 Sometimes, you may [get a black screen](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-most-known-ways-to-find-someone-on-tinder-for-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-by-name-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) instead of the actual content while streaming Netflix on Discord. When this happens, [turn off hardware acceleration](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-essential-insights-for-integrating-hashtags-into-game-focused-yt-content/) in both your [web browser](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-oneplus-ace-2-pro-adb-format-tool-for-pc-vs-other-unlocking-tools-which-one-is-the-best-by-drfone-android/) and Discord.
